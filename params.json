{"body":"# Moses Suite\r\nAuthor: [Leo Jiang](leo.jiang.dev@gmail.com) Blog: http://leohacker.wordpress.com/.\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nMoses Suite is developed for supporting OpenSource Machine Translation framework \r\nMoses SMT. Currently Moses Suite has several parts: \r\n* Moses suite base system\r\n* SMT Corpus Tools\r\n* Moses suite training tools\r\n\r\nMoses suite base system integrate upstream software (Moses and Language models)\r\nto build a base system of moses for training and decoding. Other tools aim to \r\nprovide better solution for corpus processing, training and other works in\r\nmore user friendly, flexible and customiziable way. If possible, improving user\r\nexperience is on the list of objectives.\r\n\r\nSince the storage limitation of github, I put the source code from upstream at \r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/moses-suite/.\r\n\r\nIf you find this project very interesting, don't hesitate to join me :D\r\n\r\n# Licence\r\nMoses Suite is distributed under BSD 2-Clause License (a.k.a.
