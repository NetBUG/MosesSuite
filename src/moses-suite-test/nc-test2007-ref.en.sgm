<seg id=1> Europe's Divided Racial House </seg>
<seg id=2> A common feature of Europe's extreme right is its racism and use of the immigration issue as a political wedge. </seg>
<seg id=3> The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands, the supporters of Le Pen's National Front in France, are all examples of parties or movements formed on the common theme of aversion to immigrants and promotion of simplistic policies to control them. </seg>
<seg id=4> While individuals like Jorg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen may come and (never to soon) go, the race question will not disappear from European politics anytime soon. </seg>
<seg id=5> An aging population at home and ever more open borders imply increasing racial fragmentation in European countries. </seg>
<seg id=6> Mainstream parties of the center left and center right have confronted this prospect by hiding their heads in the ground, hoping against hope that the problem will disappear. </seg>
<seg id=7> It will not, as America's racial history clearly shows. </seg>
<seg id=8> Race relations in the US have been for decades - and remain - at the center of political debate, to the point that racial cleavages are as important as income, if not more, as determinants of political preferences and attitudes. </seg>
<seg id=9> The first step to address racial politics is to understand the origin and consequences of racial animosity, even if it means uncovering unpleasant truths. </seg>
<seg id=10> This is precisely what a large amount of research in economics, sociology, psychology and political science has done for the US. </seg>
<seg id=11> This research shows that people of different races trust each other much less; whites are less willing to support welfare spending because it is perceived to favor minorities; more racially fragmented communities have less efficient governments, more corruption and patronage, more crime and fewer productive public goods per tax dollar. </seg>
<seg id=12> This does not mean that the answer is to eliminate heterogeneity and create racially homogenous communities, but an acknowledgment of the reality of these issues is needed in order to start constructing solid public policies toward race relations. </seg>
<seg id=13> Of course, Americans disagree on how to do this. </seg>
<seg id=14> Some favor affirmative action programs that provide preferences for minorities in job allocation, college admission, and public contracts. </seg>
<seg id=15> These policies are seen as a way of offering reparation for past injustices and, more importantly, for creating role models and for overcoming residual and perhaps involuntary discrimination. </seg>
<seg id=16> Others object to affirmative action, and argue that a race-blind policy coupled with free market polices and pro-family values are all that are necessary to create jobs for minorities and help keep black families together. </seg>
<seg id=17> The latter is a crucial in any policy, since one of the single most important causes of poverty in the US is the diffusion of single parents (read single mother) households in the black community. </seg>
<seg id=18> Regardless of the correct answer, the point is that determining what to do about race is a dominant issue in US politics. </seg>
<seg id=19> Of course, minorities have made progress towards more integration and economic success. </seg>
<seg id=20> In the 1950s blacks could not sit in the front of busses, today two of the main players in US foreign politics are blacks. </seg>
<seg id=21> To be sure, right wing American politicians continue deploy the "race card" as a tactical tool. </seg>
<seg id=22> Take the case of Patrick Buchanan the former Nixon and Reagan aid who became an independent presidential candidate in the last election. </seg>
<seg id=23> He recently published a successful book entitled" The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasion Imperil Our Country and Civilization." </seg>
<seg id=24> But for every book like this there are ten others with a serious analysis of America's race question. </seg>
<seg id=25> Policy analysis and debates about race relations lag terribly behind in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=26> At most the question is dealt with narrowly, in terms of immigration quotas and border restrictions, not in terms of the social problems and opportunities created by an increasingly racially mixed Europe. </seg>
<seg id=27> Of course, a clear immigration policy is needed in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants. </seg>
<seg id=28> But this cannot be the end of it: border controls with Mexico are not the end of American policy towards domestic race issues! </seg>
<seg id=29> Europe is rich and rapidly aging; Europeans, cushioned by generous welfare programs, are no longer prepared to accept "dirty jobs" in, say, agriculture or the leather industry. </seg>
<seg id=30> This makes an increase in immigration unavoidable. </seg>
<seg id=31> Europeans, however, are prompt to criticize the US for any failure in their policy toward minorities and for any manifestation of racism across the Atlantic. </seg>
<seg id=32> Reading the European press one often perceives a superiority complex towards the US over racial issues: they, the Americans, have problems with racism; we are immune from it, except for crazed neo-Nazi skinheads and their like. </seg>
<seg id=33> What has happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that the race problem in Europe is much deeper and, as in the US, stems from the sad truth that race relations are inherently difficult and trust and cooperative behavior does not travel well across racial lines. </seg>
<seg id=34> If Europe's mainstream parties do not begin a more serious investment in understanding racial tensions in Europe and put "race" as one of their main priorities, individuals like Le Pen are bound to try filling the void with their message of hate. </seg>
<seg id=35> Fighting the French Exception </seg>
<seg id=36> Europe's attention nowadays is rightly focused on enlargement and on the constitution that is currently being worked out between the EU's member states. </seg>
<seg id=37> But the outcome of several Gallic skirmishes with the European Commission will be no less important in determining the fate of the new and enlarged Europe. </seg>
<seg id=38> France has unilaterally chosen to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact by running a predicted deficit well above the 3% of GDP limit. </seg>
<seg id=39> The French like to acclaim the rational rigour of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is out and obfuscation is in. </seg>
<seg id=40> France was among the leading critics of Ireland, when, in 2000, the Irish government reduced its budget surplus, which then stood at 4% of GDP, by a mere 0.5%. </seg>
<seg id=41> Other countries have violated the Stability Pact, but France is the first to do it with smirking, open defiance. </seg>
<seg id=42> None of this should surprise anyone. </seg>
<seg id=43> France is simply applying to EU rules its engrained habit of viewing its own culture as exceptional. </seg>
<seg id=44> For example, France consistently vetoes reforms of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. </seg>
<seg id=45> As even children know, the CAP is a handsome and totally undeserved present to wealthy European (especially French) farmers at the expense of the struggling farmers of developing countries and EU consumers. </seg>
<seg id=46> France is also trying to return to old policies of bailing out unprofitable private companies on the verge of collapse with taxpayers' money. </seg>
<seg id=47> The EU Commissioner for Competition Policy, Mario Monti, cannot loose this battle: he needs the support of those who believe in markets and equal treatment for all. </seg>
<seg id=48> Here the story is simple. </seg>
<seg id=49> The French government plans to bail out Alstom, a company that developed a number of high-tech products, including the TGV, the French fast train, but recently went into bankruptcy. </seg>
<seg id=50> The French government claims that it will never back down from its plan to rescue Alstom, a plan with all the familiar dirigiste motivations: maintaining employment, protecting investors, etc. </seg>
<seg id=51> In addition, since Alstom is a high tech firm, the French government plays the research and development card, arguing that investment in R&D is good for growth. </seg>
<seg id=52> Saving Alstom by nationalizing the company is obviously wrong. </seg>
<seg id=53> The company consists of many different parts, some profitable, others bankrupt: the obvious thing to do is to break it up. </seg>
<seg id=54> The profitable parts, such as the TGV, will easily find buyers; the unprofitable plants should be closed. </seg>
<seg id=55> French taxpayers' money is better spent on temporary benefits for displaced workers than on subsidies to keep an unprofitable plant alive. </seg>
<seg id=56> It is important that the European Commission not allow France to carve out special rules for itself in competition policy, as it appears to be doing with its budget deficits. </seg>
<seg id=57> The Commission must strike down public aid to private companies in France as it strikes such subsidies down in any other EU member state. </seg>
<seg id=58> The Commission has already achieved some success on this front, notably forcing Germany to cancel government guarantees on public banks. </seg>
<seg id=59> Alstom in particular and France in general should not be an exception and should be held to the same standards. </seg>
<seg id=60> If the Commission fails to act, the EU will look even more like a playground for French public servants. </seg>
<seg id=61> France has already taken a leading role in EU foreign policy, with Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin looking and acting more and more like the foreign minister of Europe. </seg>
<seg id=62> At the same time France violates key rules of common economic policy and public aid to private companies. </seg>
<seg id=63> Will the European Commission lose what remains of its credibility and end up looking like a minor Parisian arrondissment ? </seg>
<seg id=64> A defeat on Alstom would have profound consequences in Europe--and not only for competition policy. </seg>
<seg id=65> The War for Oil </seg>
<seg id=66> For decades, through Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, America has pursued a set of straightforward energy policy objectives: keep world oil prices as stable as possible; reduce domestic consumption of oil as painlessly as possible; reduce dependence on foreign imports whenever possible; and diversify the sources of imported oil. </seg>
<seg id=67> Despite appearances, none of these objectives has changed under the Bush administration. </seg>
<seg id=68> Many observers believe that Bush has set a new course because the invasion of Iraq seems to fly in the face of these objectives. </seg>
<seg id=69> A big increase in Iraq's oil production would probably increase US dependence on oil relative to other energy sources, as world oil prices will probably fall in response to the additional supplies. </seg>
<seg id=70> This, in turn, would mean an increase in US dependence on imported oil, especially from the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=71> The irony, however, is that the US exercised greater control over the Iraqi oil sector under the UN's pre-war "Oil-for-Food Program" (in which the UN, not Saddam Hussein, determined the level of Iraqi oil sales abroad) than it will in any future democratic Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=72> If the Bush administration was seeking stable, secure, diverse and cheap oil supplies, it could have simply lifted the embargos on Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan and let the oil gush. </seg>
<seg id=73> But America's interest in Iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or energy policy. </seg>
<seg id=74> The Bush administration recognized that, above all, Iraqi oil is a critical geopolitical asset. </seg>
<seg id=75> Whoever controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=76> Saddam's power came from his control of the world's second largest oil reserve. </seg>
<seg id=77> He understood perfectly the role that oil played in his power. </seg>
<seg id=78> Faced with the possibility of invasion and defeat, Saddam threatened to burn Iraq's oil fields. </seg>
<seg id=79> Much of the subsequent destruction and looting of Iraqi oil facilities and pipelines reflects the widespread realization that control of oil means control of Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=80> As the US planned its invasion, securing the oil fields became a critical priority. </seg>
<seg id=81> The goal was not increased supplies or reduced prices for Americans, but stripping Saddam of his power and, ultimately, establishing and solidifying a new Iraqi government. </seg>
<seg id=82> Iraq's future depends directly on the fate of Iraqi oil production. </seg>
<seg id=83> Yet the vagaries of the oil business, particularly in such unsettled conditions, make it hard to see how the Bush administration will be able to achieve its goals in Iraq within the next few years. </seg>
<seg id=84> The logic is simple. </seg>
<seg id=85> The US must use oil revenues to lift the burden of financing regime change in Iraq from American taxpayers. </seg>
<seg id=86> All reconstruction plans depend in the long run on the ability of Iraq to export oil in large quantities. </seg>
<seg id=87> If Iraq does not deliver its oil, President Bush cannot deliver on his promises to the Iraqi people, the American people, or the world community. </seg>
<seg id=88> Before the invasion, Iraq's oil production capacity reached three million barrels per day. </seg>
<seg id=89> Iraq will not be able to increase its production to that level within the time frame needed to establish an Iraqi government. </seg>
<seg id=90> Any increase in Iraqi oil production requires developing the oil fields, which means big investments, a legal and representative government, and political stability. </seg>
<seg id=91> Not even the Bush administration expects these requirements to be met soon. </seg>
<seg id=92> Indeed, political stability is the main condition for increasing production capacity. </seg>
<seg id=93> Historical evidence from Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq itself, indicates that it takes about three years from the re-establishment of political stability for capacity to increase significantly and for those new higher levels to be sustained. </seg>
<seg id=94> Iraq needs several years to write a new constitution, establish a legitimate and democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues among its various regions, enact new investment laws, and make the economy attractive to foreigners. </seg>
<seg id=95> It also needs time to negotiate with the international oil companies and neighboring countries, to perform technical and feasibility studies, and to reconstruct, rehabilitate, and explore its oil fields. </seg>
<seg id=96> So even a three-year time frame seems optimistic, for it assumes that within that period, the occupation will end, Iraqis will establish their own democratic government, and that political stability will be achieved. </seg>
<seg id=97> Needless to say, the situation may play out differently. </seg>
<seg id=98> Tensions may remain high for years. </seg>
<seg id=99> No one should be surprised, moreover, if Iraqi oil production suddenly stops altogether even under a democratic government. </seg>
<seg id=100> History suggests that labor strikes and similar disruptions that can halt oil production are a greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries. </seg>
<seg id=101> If Iraq cannot quickly increase its production capacity in the next few years, this will hinder both US foreign and energy policies. </seg>
<seg id=102> How will the US finance the long-term reconstruction of Iraq? </seg>
<seg id=103> Who will pay to maintain a fragile Iraqi democracy? </seg>
<seg id=104> Can the US sustain its occupation if it cannot provide food, health care, and other basic services to Iraq's people? </seg>
<seg id=105> These are tough questions, and they are fundamentally unanswerable until a stable, democratic regime in Iraq can control and ensure a steady flow of oil exports. </seg>
<seg id=106> Letting Killers Guard Human Rights </seg>
<seg id=107> If it were not so profoundly sad, it would qualify as the sick joke of the millennium: Libya has been elected to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights! </seg>
<seg id=108> When Caligula appointed his horse to the Senate, the horse at least did not have blood on its hoofs. </seg>
<seg id=109> The procedure, of course, was perfectly legal: the chairmanship rotates every year from one global region to another. </seg>
<seg id=110> This year it was Africa's turn to nominate the chairman, and they nominated Libya. </seg>
<seg id=111> Only the US and Canada voted against. </seg>
<seg id=112> To their everlasting shame, European countries abstained. </seg>
<seg id=113> It is a telling commentary on the moral bankruptcy of the UN that this decision comes at so delicate a time for the organization. </seg>
<seg id=114> President Bush has challenged the UN to show its seriousness about its own mandatory decisions about Iraq: otherwise it may meet the same ignominious end as the League of Nations, which proved impotent in the 1930's when confronted with the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. </seg>
<seg id=115> To have Libya elected at this moment to chair the UN body responsible for human rights hardly helps support either the legitimacy or the moral authority of the world body. </seg>
<seg id=116> Let us remember: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines sometimes erratic behavior with extremist policies, supporting dictators all over the world. </seg>
<seg id=117> He heads one of the world's most oppressive regimes, where there is no pretense at elections and where dissent is instantly crushed. </seg>
<seg id=118> Under his rule, Libya has supported terrorist organizations worldwide--from the IRA to various Palestinian extremist groups. </seg>
<seg id=119> It remains under UN sanctions for its role in the downing of a Pan Am passenger flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago. </seg>
<seg id=120> In the last decade, the position of the UN as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has been steadily eroded. </seg>
<seg id=121> It proved utterly unable to stop the wars in the Balkans; and in at least one case--Srebrenica--a Dutch UN peacekeeping force stood by and witnessed the worst massacre in post-1945 Europe, as Bosnian Serbs murdered around 6,000 defenseless Muslim men. </seg>
<seg id=122> A Dutch commission of enquiry later admitted that the UN Dutch battalion was, in fact, complicit in that war crime. </seg>
<seg id=123> In Rwanda, once the genocide started, the UN official responsible for peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of UN forces from the country, leaving the field wide open to the bloodiest genocidal massacre since World War II. </seg>
<seg id=124> That UN official's name is Kofi Annan. </seg>
<seg id=125> It is a depressing, pathetic record, which the UN is trying--probably in vain--to redeem by appearing, in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and international legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id=126> But at a time when UN inspections in Iraq seem like sending the Salvation Army to clear out a band of gangsters, raising Libya to head the Human Rights Commission may go down in history as the definitive failure of an organization whose life started with so much hope. </seg>
<seg id=127> Organizations usually don't die--and certainly there is too much raison d'etat to make certain that the UN will continue to hobble on. </seg>
<seg id=128> But it will be a mere shadow of what it should, and could, be. </seg>
<seg id=129> Today's UN gives hypocrisy a bad name. </seg>
<seg id=130> Authoritarians at the Gate </seg>
<seg id=131> Last Thursday, judges at Indonesia's Central Jakarta Court sentenced me to one year in prison. </seg>
<seg id=132> As the editor-in-chief of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine , I am guilty, according to the court, of defaming a business tycoon named Tomy Winata by implying his possible involvement in a fire at Jakarta's South-East Asia textile market, and of fomenting riots by disseminating lies. </seg>
<seg id=133> Does my case, and others like it, portend the end of yet another short-lived experiment with democracy in Indonesia? </seg>
<seg id=134> The "riot" that I allegedly fomented occurred in March last year, when almost two hundred thugs claiming to be Winata's followers attacked Tempo's office, threatened to burn down the building, harassed staff, and injured one reporter. </seg>
<seg id=135> Trying to help resolve the situation peacefully, I was persuaded to negotiate at the Central Jakarta Police Station, but found to my horror that the mob leaders controlled the station. </seg>
<seg id=136> I was punched and kicked as the police looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id=137> Fortunately, many journalists came to our rescue with tape recorders and cameras rolling. </seg>
<seg id=138> Their broadcasts caused a public outcry, which forced our parliament to organize a public hearing. </seg>
<seg id=139> The National and Jakarta police chiefs were called and, under massive public pressure, the leaders of the mob were criminally charged. </seg>
<seg id=140> But Winata himself eluded police investigation, merely by claiming publicly that his followers acted without his prior knowledge and consent. </seg>
<seg id=141> He then filed criminal charges of his own, against Ahmad Taufik, who wrote the article, Teuku Iskandar Ali, who edited it, and me. </seg>
<seg id=142> The yearlong court proceedings were marked by a series of suspicious developments, all favoring Winata. </seg>
<seg id=143> First, the case built by the police and state prosecutor contained documents that were so blatantly falsified that the police indicted two officers. </seg>
<seg id=144> But the court rejected our request that proceedings be delayed until the legality of the state's case could be clarified. </seg>
<seg id=145> The case against the officers involved appears to be going nowhere. </seg>
<seg id=146> On the contrary, one of them has been promoted to command the newly formed (and US-funded) Jakarta Anti-Terror Unit. </seg>
<seg id=147> The other has reportedly been sent to the police staff school for advanced training. </seg>
<seg id=148> Then, in the sixth month of the case, the Head Judge in the three-judge panel was suddenly promoted to become the head of a city court an hour from Jakarta. </seg>
<seg id=149> One of my lawyers noted that in his 35 years experience at the court, he had never seen a Head Judge replaced in an ongoing case. </seg>
<seg id=150> In fact, despite her promotion, the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building. </seg>
<seg id=151> A judge who had previously ruled against Tempo in Winata's civil suit filled her vacancy. </seg>
<seg id=152> Finally, when Winata testified, he perjured himself by denying that Tempo had interviewed him. </seg>
<seg id=153> A recording of the telephone interview was played in court; sworn testimony was heard from the reporter who conducted the interview and from two editors who witnessed it; the official record from the telephone company was submitted as evidence of the call; and an expert witness concluded that the voice on the recording belonged to Tomy Winata. </seg>
<seg id=154> But the judges denied Tempo's request that Winata be arrested and tried for perjury, telling us to report it to the police, which we did. </seg>
<seg id=155> The judges then denied our request for a postponement of the court decision until Mr. Winata's perjury case was resolved. </seg>
<seg id=156> Given such flawed proceedings, my conviction and prison sentence come as no surprise. </seg>
<seg id=157> But I remain hopeful that we will prevail in the end, when higher courts hear Tempo's appeal. </seg>
<seg id=158> Indonesia's courts are cleaner at the top, and the Head of the Supreme Court is a staunch advocate of democracy and press freedom. Tempo's case could become a landmark victory for our democracy, like the US Supreme Court's famous decision in The New York Times v. Sullivan . </seg>
<seg id=159> By raising the bar for defamation charges, that decision ensures that American journalists can hold public officials accountable. </seg>
<seg id=160> No country knows better than Indonesia that free speech and a free press are proven indicators of democratic development, and that criminalizing journalists is an early symptom of authoritarianism. </seg>
<seg id=161> Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950's, before President Sukarno, supported by the military, began a crackdown on the press in 1956. </seg>
<seg id=162> With critical voices silenced, consolidating unchecked power became easier and, in July 1959, Sukarno decreed the beginning of "Guided Democracy." </seg>
<seg id=163> For the first few years after Sukarno's fall in 1966, all the benefits of genuine democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the communists). </seg>
<seg id=164> But President Suharto's regime began another press crackdown in the early 1970's, ultimately banning various media and jailing many journalists. </seg>
<seg id=165> With the press under control, other political rights were quickly curtailed and Indonesian democracy failed again. </seg>
<seg id=166> Since Suharto's fall in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest democratic Muslim community in history. </seg>
<seg id=167> Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections - including the latest presidential run-off - have been free, fair, and peaceful, proving that Islam and democracy can coexist. </seg>
<seg id=168> Democracy's enemies, however, never rest. </seg>
<seg id=169> Radical Islamic groups have engaged in indiscriminate bombings, while groups with strong authoritarian tendencies have made inroads into President Megawati's inner circle. </seg>
<seg id=170> But Mrs Megawati has just been defeated in her bid for reelection. </seg>
<seg id=171> Will newly elected President Susilo continue to prosecute journalists? </seg>
<seg id=172> Will my conviction, and the trials and convictions of other journalists, mark the beginning of the end of Indonesia's hard-won third democracy? </seg>
<seg id=173> The answer lies in the support that Indonesian pro-democracy activists can generate domestically and internationally. </seg>
<seg id=174> To lose Indonesia - a potential beacon of hope to all pro-democracy activists in the world Muslim community - would be a terrible defeat. </seg>
<seg id=175> The Morality of Capital Punishment </seg>
<seg id=176> The US is often criticized for its refusal to abolish capital punishment. </seg>
<seg id=177> Many now claim that abolition of capital punishment is a precondition of a civilized criminal-law system. </seg>
<seg id=178> Nobel laureate Gary Becker disagrees. </seg>
<seg id=179> European governments are adamantly opposed to capital punishment -- the European Union bans it outright -- and some Europeans consider its use in the United States barbaric. </seg>
<seg id=180> Indeed, many European intellectuals argue that not just capital punishment, but punishment in general, does not deter criminals. </seg>
<seg id=181> But, whereas Europeans, with crime rates well below American rates for the past half-century, could long afford to be relatively "soft" on most crimes, they have seen their crime rates increase sharply during the past twenty years. </seg>
<seg id=182> By contrast, American rates have fallen, in part because of greater use of punishment. </seg>
<seg id=183> This includes capital punishment. </seg>
<seg id=184> I support executing some people convicted of murder because -- and only because -- I believe that it deters other murders. </seg>
<seg id=185> If I did not believe that, I would oppose capital punishment, because revenge and other possible motives should not be a basis for public policy. </seg>
<seg id=186> Serious empirical research on capital punishment in the US began with a pioneering study by Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American Economic Review. </seg>
<seg id=187> Some subsequent studies have sometimes found a much weaker deterrent effect, while others have found a much stronger effect. </seg>
<seg id=188> The available data are quite limited, however, so one should not base any conclusions solely on the econometric evidence. </seg>
<seg id=189> Of course, public policy on any punishment cannot wait until the evidence is perfect. </seg>
<seg id=190> But, even with the limited quantitative evidence available, there are good reasons to believe that capital punishment deters. </seg>
<seg id=191> Most people, and murderers in particular, fear death, especially when it follows swiftly and with considerable certainty following the commission of a murder. </seg>
<seg id=192> As David Hume put it in discussing suicide, "no man ever threw away life, while it was worth living. </seg>
<seg id=193> For such is our natural horror of death…" Likewise, Schopenhauer believed that "as soon as the terrors of life reach a point at which they outweigh the terrors of death, a man will put an end to his life. </seg>
<seg id=194> But the terrors of death offer considerable resistance…" </seg>
<seg id=195> Opponents of capital punishment frequently proclaim that the state has no moral right to take anyone's life, including that of the most reprehensible murderer. </seg>
<seg id=196> Yet that is absolutely the wrong conclusion for anyone who believes that capital punishment deters. </seg>
<seg id=197> To see why, suppose that for each murderer executed (instead of, say, receiving life imprisonment), the number of murders is reduced by three, which is a much lower number than Ehrlich's and some other estimates of the deterrent effect. </seg>
<seg id=198> This implies that for each murderer not executed, three innocent victims would die. </seg>
<seg id=199> In fact, the government would indirectly be "taking" many lives if it did not use capital punishment. </seg>
<seg id=200> Saving three innocent lives for every person executed seems like a very attractive trade-off, and even two lives saved per execution seems like a persuasive benefit-cost ratio for capital punishment. </seg>
<seg id=201> Admittedly, however, the argument in favor of capital punishment becomes less clear-cut as the number of lives saved per execution falls. </seg>
<seg id=202> But, even if only one life were saved per execution, the tradeoff might still be desirable if the life saved is much better than the life taken, which would usually be the case. </seg>
<seg id=203> Many people object to comparing the quality of the life spared and the life taken. </seg>
<seg id=204> Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison. </seg>
<seg id=205> Consider a career criminal who robs and kills a victim who led a decent life and left several children and a spouse behind. </seg>
<seg id=206> Suppose it would be possible to save the life of an innocent victim by executing such a criminal. </seg>
<seg id=207> To me it is obvious that saving such a victim's life must count for more than taking the criminal's life. </seg>
<seg id=208> Obviously, not all cases are so unambiguous, but a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy. </seg>
<seg id=209> This helps explain why capital punishment should be used only for murders, and not for lesser crimes. </seg>
<seg id=210> When the tradeoff is between taking lives and, say, reducing property theft, the case for milder punishments is far stronger. </seg>
<seg id=211> Although severe assaults, including some gruesome rapes, may approach some murders in severity, and might conceivably call for capital punishment, I do not support its use in these cases. </seg>
<seg id=212> A powerful argument for reserving capital punishment for murders is "marginal deterrence." </seg>
<seg id=213> If assault were punished with execution, perpetrators would have an incentive to kill their victims to avoid discovery (which is a major reason why the severity of punishments more generally should be matched to the severity of crimes). </seg>
<seg id=214> One complication is that capital punishment may make a murderer fight harder to avoid being captured, which could lead to more deaths. </seg>
<seg id=215> But, while marginal deterrence is important, I believe the resistance of murderers to being captured, possibly at the expense of their own lives, is really indirect evidence that criminals do fear capital punishment. </seg>
<seg id=216> Of course, I worry about the risk of executing the innocent. </seg>
<seg id=217> My support for capital punishment would weaken greatly if the rate of killing innocent people were as large as that claimed by many. </seg>
<seg id=218> However, I believe that the appeal process in the US offers enormous protection, not so much against wrongful conviction as against wrongful execution, so that there are very few, if any, documented cases of innocent people being killed. </seg>
<seg id=219> And this process has been strengthened enormously with the development of DNA identification. </seg>
<seg id=220> Again, the debate about capital punishment is essentially a debate about deterrence (which may be reduced by lengthy appeals). </seg>
<seg id=221> I can understand that some people are skeptical about the evidence, although I believe they are wrong about both that and the common sense of the issue. </seg>
<seg id=222> It is very disturbing to take someone's life, even a murderer's life, but sometimes highly unpleasant actions are necessary to prevent even worse behavior that takes the lives of innocent victims. </seg>
<seg id=223> The People Versus Putin </seg>
<seg id=224> I helped select Vladimir Putin to succeed Russia's first democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin. </seg>
<seg id=225> Because KGB/Mafia structures now rule Russia and manipulate the judicial system, it is assumed that Yeltsin wanted to handpick his successor in order to avoid future prosecution. </seg>
<seg id=226> But we who chose Putin were charged with finding someone to continue Yeltsin's reforms, not shield him and his family. </seg>
<seg id=227> Indeed, Yeltsin was fearless, and sought not his personal survival, but the survival of the democratic idea that he introduced to Russia. </seg>
<seg id=228> Yet that idea is now under threat because of the successor we chose. </seg>
<seg id=229> I don't deny my responsibility for supporting Putin. </seg>
<seg id=230> We weren't close friends, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted his sincerity. </seg>
<seg id=231> Putin acts according to his convictions. </seg>
<seg id=232> The problem is that his convictions -- including his belief that Russia can prosper only if it is ruled by a single source of power -- are wrong. </seg>
<seg id=233> This gross error is leading Russia to political ruin. </seg>
<seg id=234> Of course, no one holds high office without making mistakes, even fundamental ones, and this is especially true in tumultuous periods. </seg>
<seg id=235> Yeltsin was no exception, but he recognized his errors. </seg>
<seg id=236> When he retired on New Year's Eve 1999, for example, he asked forgiveness for launching the war in Chechnya. </seg>
<seg id=237> Putin, by contrast, seems incapable of recognizing and admitting his mistakes, and persists in a policy long after its failure is visible to the world. </seg>
<seg id=238> One of Yeltsin's errors was his failure to put moral priorities at the head of his reform agenda. </seg>
<seg id=239> Russia should have repented for Stalinism and the gulag system. </seg>
<seg id=240> The whole nation, with no exception, should have repented, the way the Germans have repented since 1945. </seg>
<seg id=241> This failure matters, for it allowed Putin's unqualified belief in central authority to lead to the recapture of the state by the security services. </seg>
<seg id=242> Indeed, a direct result of national repentance for the gulag era should have been the banning of the communist party and the disqualification from political office of those who worked in the KGB. </seg>
<seg id=243> Although such political screenings are complicated in postcommunist societies, where both victimhood and collaboration were so widespread -- and the lines between them so often blurred -- a sound solution could have been found, as in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id=244> Doing nothing left Russia's security structures unscathed and able to make a political comeback, which they have now achieved. </seg>
<seg id=245> The political resurrection of KGB structures under Putin, and their efforts to silence dissent, has once again turned Russia into a country of defectors. </seg>
<seg id=246> It is impossible to silence independent politicians and independent media without choking off independent sources of money, which is why Putin's Kremlin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called "oligarchs." </seg>
<seg id=247> Mikhail Khodorkovsky's arrest and trial were orchestrated for precisely this reason. </seg>
<seg id=248> By removing independent sources of money, the security services that dominate the Kremlin hope to destroy independent political life in Russia. </seg>
<seg id=249> Without independent bases of thought, a climate of fear is taking hold. </seg>
<seg id=250> But fear is not only degrading; it makes for poor governance. </seg>
<seg id=251> Yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and top-down, centralized decision-making were no way to rule a modern country, and he therefore insisted on reforming relations between citizens and the state. </seg>
<seg id=252> Putin still doesn't understand that a centralized political system is as incapable of comprehending and correcting mistakes now as it was in the Soviet era. </seg>
<seg id=253> Not being a well-educated man Putin is, in full and deep sincerity, leading Russia toward the same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state. </seg>
<seg id=254> People are beginning to realize this. </seg>
<seg id=255> They see that Putin's desire to create a strong and effective modern state cannot be realized, because a modern state is governed not from above, but by an informed citizenry that forces its rulers to acknowledge and correct their mistakes. </seg>
<seg id=256> Putin, too, also seems to suspect his regime's impotence. </seg>
<seg id=257> This is one reason why Russia has become so aggressive with its neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia, and seeks to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the breakaway region of Moldova. </seg>
<seg id=258> By throwing its weight around in Russia's near abroad, the Kremlin thinks that it can convince Russians back home of its omnipotence. </seg>
<seg id=259> Given the neutered debates in Russia, and the Kremlin's ability to manipulate elections, regime change is the only option left for those who want to preserve the democratic idea in Russia. </seg>
<seg id=260> There is no use holding onto illusions. </seg>
<seg id=261> Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and declare that, if the regime fails to uphold the constitution, they have the right to force it to do so by any means necessary. </seg>
<seg id=262> Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer be decided solely at the ballot box. </seg>
<seg id=263> As in Ukraine, Lebanon, and Kyrgizstan, it will be decided in the streets. </seg>
<seg id=264> Tax and spend (Please) </seg>
<seg id=265> Excessive taxation can dull incentives and hinder growth. </seg>
<seg id=266> But too little taxation can do the same. </seg>
<seg id=267> Governments with meager tax revenues can't provide basic public goods. </seg>
<seg id=268> Worse yet, low tax revenues in poor countries often result from defects in tax collection systems (rather than low tax rates) that also promote unproductive enterprise. </seg>
<seg id=269> India illustrates the importance of a well-designed tax system. </seg>
<seg id=270> In Bangalore, high-tech companies have built world-class campuses replete with manicured lawns and high-speed data communication networks. </seg>
<seg id=271> Outside these campuses, however, lie open sewers, uncollected garbage, and roads in acute disrepair. </seg>
<seg id=272> Whereas technology companies instantaneously transmit terabytes of data to remote continents, local transport proceeds at an almost medieval pace. </seg>
<seg id=273> As a result, businesses in Bangalore run their own bus services, contract with private suppliers for drinking water, and install generators to protect themselves from interruptions in electricity supply. </seg>
<seg id=274> The state can't fix the shambles because it is broke. </seg>
<seg id=275> India's government debt exceeds 70% of GDP, so more than half its tax receipts go to paying interest. </seg>
<seg id=276> But the debt isn't because of excessive spending in the past. </seg>
<seg id=277> India's government expenditures amount to about 15% of GDP, compared to an average of around 40% of GDP in the OECD. </seg>
<seg id=278> Rather, India's financial difficulties stem from a badly designed and administered tax system. </seg>
<seg id=279> Rates and rules for personal and corporate income taxes appear reasonable by international standards. </seg>
<seg id=280> Nonetheless, India's government collects income taxes amounting to only about 3.7% of GDP, about half that in South Korea and the other Asian tigers. </seg>
<seg id=281> Agriculture in India accounts for about a quarter of GDP, but even wealthy farmers don't pay taxes. </seg>
<seg id=282> Export-oriented companies in the software and other industries enjoy tax holidays on their profits, although their employees do pay taxes on their personal incomes. </seg>
<seg id=283> Despite reasonable rates, tax evasion is widespread. </seg>
<seg id=284> Cheating occurs because the government hasn't invested in personnel or in the systems to detect tax evaders, who rarely face jail time and can often bribe their way out of trouble when they do get caught. </seg>
<seg id=285> More subtly, the evasion of "direct" taxes on incomes and profits reflects the mess in the system of "indirect" taxes levied on production and consumption. </seg>
<seg id=286> Excise taxes account for over 60% of India's indirect taxes, which in turn represent the same proportion of its total tax receipts. </seg>
<seg id=287> The basic excise tax has been fixed at 16% of the value of a firm's output. </seg>
<seg id=288> Then there are a variety of concessions, exemptions, and surcharges. </seg>
<seg id=289> For instance a "concessionary duty rate" of 8% is levied on categories like food products, matches, cotton yarn, and computers. </seg>
<seg id=290> An additional "special excise duty" (SED) of 8% is levied on products that include polyester filament, cars, air conditioners and tires. </seg>
<seg id=291> An "additional excise duty" (AED, not to be confused with the SED) is levied on "goods of special importance." </seg>
<seg id=292> Exemptions from excise taxes are numerous and complex, including businesses with total annual revenues of less than 10 million rupees and firms located in certain troubled or backward areas. </seg>
<seg id=293> Overall, the exemptions fall under 70 broad categories, subdivided into 259 entries, 52 conditions, and 7 lists, each containing numerous items. </seg>
<seg id=294> Exemptions invite abuse. </seg>
<seg id=295> For a price, low ranking officials, who have considerable discretion in applying the conditions, can be persuaded to reach favorable interpretations. </seg>
<seg id=296> Goods taxed at high rates (for example, polished granite) are sold as goods taxed at lower rates (for example, as unpolished granite). </seg>
<seg id=297> Evasion of excise taxes is more contagious than evasion of taxes on profits and incomes. </seg>
<seg id=298> If one firm evades excise taxes, and the tax rate is high compared to pre-tax profit margins in the industry, its competitors also have to cheat, just in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id=299> As evasion increases, governments levy "additional" or "special" duties, inciting further evasion. </seg>
<seg id=300> Collections of direct taxes also suffer. </seg>
<seg id=301> The bribe paid to the excise tax collector for a favorable classification, the difference between the value of polished and unpolished granite, and the under-reporting of true revenues create "black" funds, which cannot be declared on income-tax returns. </seg>
<seg id=302> In addition to impairing the state's ability to provide basic public goods, schemes to evade indirect taxes also discourage businesses from adopting more productive technologies, which requires technologies that involve large-scale operation. </seg>
<seg id=303> But, because indirect taxes are more easily avoided by operating many small units instead of one large unit, economies of scale cannot be realized. </seg>
<seg id=304> It's worth noting that in the software industry, where all units are exempt from indirect taxes, Indian companies do operate at efficient scale. </seg>
<seg id=305> Could India emulate China's example, where the rationalization of indirect taxes in 1994 set the stage for a great boom? </seg>
<seg id=306> Or are coalition governments in a vigorous democracy incapable of such reform? </seg>
<seg id=307> Last year India's BJP-led government introduced legislation mandating sharp reductions in the budget deficit. </seg>
<seg id=308> It then appointed a task force to formulate the necessary changes in tax and spending policies. </seg>
<seg id=309> This July, the task force proposed raising taxes (rather than cutting spending), through, among other things, removing most indirect tax exemptions. </seg>
<seg id=310> India's new Congress-led government, too, seems to favor these proposals. </seg>
<seg id=311> If Congress and the opposition parties follow through, they will go a long way to sustaining the country's economic growth and in dispelling the idea that democracies cannot do what's needed to encourage development. </seg>
<seg id=312> What's Wrong With Turkey? </seg>
<seg id=313> On December 16, Orhan Pamuk, one of Turkey's most famous writers, will enter an Istanbul court to face a charge of "insulting the national identity" after he advocated open discussion of the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916. </seg>
<seg id=314> Pamuk faces three years in prison. </seg>
<seg id=315> Turkey's effort to fine and imprison those who do not toe the official line convinces me that I was correct to oppose opening negotiations on the country's European Union membership. </seg>
<seg id=316> In December 1999, the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate-member, implying that Turkey would accede to the Union at some future, unspecified date. </seg>
<seg id=317> The Council subsequently asked the European Commission to decide by October 2004 whether Turkey had sufficiently fulfilled the political criteria -- including democracy, the rule of law, and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities -- for membership. </seg>
<seg id=318> That decision was one of the last taken by Romano Prodi's Commission, of which I was a member. </seg>
<seg id=319> Of its 30 members, 29 said that Turkey had fulfilled the criteria sufficiently to proceed. </seg>
<seg id=320> I was the lone dissenter. </seg>
<seg id=321> The Commission's own report on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, who was then in charge of EU enlargement, shaped my decision. </seg>
<seg id=322> This report mentioned that in 2003 some 21,870 Turks submitted asylum claims in the EU, of which 2,127 were accepted. </seg>
<seg id=323> In other words, the EU's own governments acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted more than 2,000 of its own citizens. </seg>
<seg id=324> Meanwhile, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey that granted that reforms were continuing, albeit at a slower pace, under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's mildly Islamic-minded government. </seg>
<seg id=325> Yet the report also presented serious misgivings: human rights violations, including torture, continued; the military's influence remained too high; freedom of speech was not universally observed; non-Muslim religious and cultural minorities faced discrimination; and violence against women was not opposed strongly enough. </seg>
<seg id=326> Not much has changed since accession talks began this October. </seg>
<seg id=327> Beyond the current persecution of Pamuk, unacceptable behavior abounds. </seg>
<seg id=328> In March 2005, the police violently disrupted a demonstration to celebrate International Women's Day. </seg>
<seg id=329> In May, the largest teachers' union was banned for promoting the education of Turkey's 14 million Kurds in their own language. </seg>
<seg id=330> Indeed, intolerance goes right to the top of the Turkish government. </seg>
<seg id=331> Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül abruptly cancelled a recent press conference in Copenhagen when he spied a Kurdish journalist in the audience and the Danes refused to evict him. </seg>
<seg id=332> Such actions and attitudes amply justify my dissent of October 2004. </seg>
<seg id=333> But, even if these shortcomings were removed, Turkey should still not be admitted to the EU, because it is not a European country. </seg>
<seg id=334> Christianity, feudalism, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy, and industrialization have made us what we Europeans are, but they have not made Turks who they are. </seg>
<seg id=335> So I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession. </seg>
<seg id=336> Indeed, I suspect that there will be backsliding. </seg>
<seg id=337> Moreover, Turkey's accession would lead inevitably to that of Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaïdjan. </seg>
<seg id=338> The first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=339> Leaving the three Caucasian republics aside but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, this would mean an EU of some 35 members. </seg>
<seg id=340> What sort of Union would that be? </seg>
<seg id=341> The EU is not simply a club of friends. </seg>
<seg id=342> It is based on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and people. </seg>
<seg id=343> The Commission, as the guardian of the Union's treaties, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary force, member states to change their laws. </seg>
<seg id=344> Alcohol policy in Sweden, the Volkswagen-law in Germany, and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases that made the Commission unpopular. </seg>
<seg id=345> But they were necessary. </seg>
<seg id=346> By the time I left the Commission, I was sitting on a pile of 1,500 such infringement proceedings. </seg>
<seg id=347> In short, EU membership entails having to accept incisive measures that deeply affect a state's internal affairs. </seg>
<seg id=348> That will be impossible with such disparate members. </seg>
<seg id=349> The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls "imperial overreach." </seg>
<seg id=350> The EU would become unacceptably diluted. </seg>
<seg id=351> That is why former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkey's entry would lead to the EU's breakup, and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, "Accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear." </seg>
<seg id=352> But the strongest reason to oppose Turkey's accession is a question of democracy: a majority of the EU's population simply does not want it. </seg>
<seg id=353> Bolivia's Crisis, Latin America's Failure </seg>
<seg id=354> Bolivia is not a typical Latin American country by any definition. </seg>
<seg id=355> But for Haiti, it is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, and it is even less stable, with a history of more than two hundred coups since independence. </seg>
<seg id=356> In a region with a strong indigenous past but a scattered and isolated present, Bolivia is, alongside Guatemala, perhaps the only country in Latin America where indigenous peoples make up a majority of the population. </seg>
<seg id=357> Its topography and ethnic distribution are generating autonomist and even secessionist forces that threaten national unity in more menacing ways than anywhere else. </seg>
<seg id=358> And, of course, it is, with Paraguay, the only land-locked nation on the sub-continent. </seg>
<seg id=359> So it would be highly imprudent to extrapolate Bolivia's current crisis to the rest of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id=360> It is far too simple to generalize: institutions elsewhere are much stronger, poverty -- and particularly extreme poverty -- have been diminishing, and the battle over natural resources has been largely settled. </seg>
<seg id=361> Even in places like Venezuela, with both huge oil reserves and a traditional-minded nationalist government, the status quo allowing for foreign investment in energy resources has survived nearly eight years of President Hugo Chavez. </seg>
<seg id=362> While the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, from Chiapas to "Araucania," from Amazonia to Ayacucho, nowhere in Latin America have they posed a genuine threat to national integrity. </seg>
<seg id=363> So Bolivia is not a premonitory crisis; nor does the hoary old "domino theory," to which both Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara subscribed in the case of Bolivia, seem valid or even half-way reasonable. </seg>
<seg id=364> Yet Bolivia's current crisis does point to the "democratic deficit" that plagues Latin America today. </seg>
<seg id=365> Elected leaders have fallen for one reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Haiti. </seg>
<seg id=366> Democracy is either defective or missing in Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua, and it is threatened by one cause or another in Venezuela and Colombia. </seg>
<seg id=367> None of these cases are identical to the others; they include varying degrees of danger, harm, or reconciliation. </seg>
<seg id=368> The question is what can be done about this state of affairs, which contrasts starkly with the encouraging outlook that prevailed just a few years back. </seg>
<seg id=369> At the last Organization of American States assembly in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the United States delegation took a good idea from others and, by its support, essentially sank it. </seg>
<seg id=370> The story began a couple of years ago, when former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and the United Nations Development Program were charged with drafting the Latin American Democracy Report. </seg>
<seg id=371> They concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help generate action before matters got out of control, as in Bolivia today. </seg>
<seg id=372> Caputo and the UN team then convinced Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take up the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id=373> He did, but the initiative did not get very far. </seg>
<seg id=374> In fact, The UNDP/Latin America Democracy Report, published in 2004, barely mentioned it. </seg>
<seg id=375> The US and the new Chilean Secretary General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, resurrected the plan during the OAS meeting in Florida, but it was shot down by Latin Americans' reasonable fears that the idea was directed against Venezuela, mingled with Latin Americans' anachronistic fears of violating the sacrosanct principle of non-intervention. </seg>
<seg id=376> Despite the continent's failure to agree on the principle, the idea of an early-warning system deserves attention. </seg>
<seg id=377> Today there may be little that the hemispheric community can do about the situation in Bolivia, and yet it is fraught with danger for everyone. </seg>
<seg id=378> Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and of the coca-leaf growers, may be an honest, if misguided, democratic leader, but are his followers untainted by authoritarian desires? </seg>
<seg id=379> Hugo Chavez may not be financing Morales and Bolivia's other dissidents, but are Venezuela and Cuba really not tempted to meddle in the country where Che Guevara died leading a guerrilla war nearly 40 years ago? </seg>
<seg id=380> Bolivia's Santa Cruz business community may not carry out its threat to secede, but will they prefer to share their region's oil and gas reserves with the indigenous highland peoples rather than with Brazilian industrialists from São Paulo? </seg>
<seg id=381> Before events reached these extremes, it might have been a good idea for the OAS (not the US) to get involved. </seg>
<seg id=382> The region continues to need that involvement -- on time, on message, and on a proper democratic platform, one that is distinct from both traditional US intervention and Latin America's traditional indifference. </seg>
<seg id=383> The Decline of France? </seg>
<seg id=384> The French are notoriously sensitive--if not defensive--about France's stature in the world. </seg>
<seg id=385> The French state spends vast amounts of money to propagate the French language and French culture, yet the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is not what it once was. </seg>
<seg id=386> No surprise, then, that during the last presidential election, the publication of a European Commission report claiming France's economic rank among European countries had fallen from 3 </seg>
<seg id=387> The OECD and Eurostat, the European body in charge of such data, thought they put an end to this aspect of the debate by showing that France, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain all enjoy roughly equal per capita living standards. </seg>
<seg id=388> But the broader controversy wouldn't go away. </seg>
<seg id=389> Worried talk about "French decline" reappeared with this year's street protests against pension reform, mounting disputes over fiscal policy with the European Commission, and bickering with America over the war in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=390> Today's best-selling non-fiction book in France is a polemic by Nicolas Baverez, La France qui tombe (Falling France). </seg>
<seg id=391> Baverez's book is filled with quotations from de Gaulle and Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id=392> According to the author, France's last great achievements were in the 1970's, when the fast train, the TGV, and Airbus were launched. </seg>
<seg id=393> He castigates both Mitterrand and Chirac for their "common talent to win elections and turn France into a loser." </seg>
<seg id=394> The book's success is itself a sign of a kind of "malaise." </seg>
<seg id=395> But of which kind? </seg>
<seg id=396> Baverez's evidence of degeneration is not as convincing as he believes. </seg>
<seg id=397> For example, he cites the draining away of industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of France's decline. </seg>
<seg id=398> But deindustrialization is common to all advanced countries. </seg>
<seg id=399> Indeed, France does actually better than most of its rich country rivals and, unlike Germany, the UK, or the US, has retained the same global market share in the industrial sector that it had in the early 1970's. </seg>
<seg id=400> Moreover, according to a better measure of comptetitiveness, foreign investment, France does very well. </seg>
<seg id=401> According to a recent report by the Economic Analysis Council, direct investment in France grew to 60 billion euros in 2001, almost twice that of Germany. </seg>
<seg id=402> French cost competitiveness also improved (by 20%) in the last three decades, with higher productivity offsetting rapid wage growth. </seg>
<seg id=403> But the core of France's long-run economic problems is precisely the fear of losing industrial jobs. </seg>
<seg id=404> France remains a strong industrial power in traditional areas such as automobile and aerospace industries, but it is falling behind in innovative markets, where smaller companies spread new technologies. </seg>
<seg id=405> France, for instance, spends only $30 billion annually on high tech R&D, compared with $51 billion in Germany, $98 billion in Japan, and $265 billion in the US. </seg>
<seg id=406> In short, Baverez's analysis points in the wrong direction. </seg>
<seg id=407> France has undergone a set of critically important reforms over the past two decades: economic and financial liberalization, elimination of price and foreign exchange controls, the end of credit restrictions, European liberalization, reduced inflation and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and the forced globalization of the country's firms. </seg>
<seg id=408> The French malaise has nothing to do with any of them. </seg>
<seg id=409> France's problem is that it fails to recognize the new world of which it already is a part. </seg>
<seg id=410> French state capitalism is dead, and France is finding it hard to come to terms with its passing. </seg>
<seg id=411> Indeed, France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, feels obliged to apologize the day after for saying on TV that "the state is not omnipotent." </seg>
<seg id=412> There are many reasons for this French schyzophrenia, but a critical one has to do with the political game of the past 20 years. </seg>
<seg id=413> Until 1981, France had a clear division between right and left. </seg>
<seg id=414> Since then, both the Mitterand and Chirac administrations blunted their ideological edge in order to carry the difficult process of adjustment towards Europe and globalization. </seg>
<seg id=415> A round of "shock therapy" à la Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago might have forged a new political consciousness. </seg>
<seg id=416> But the consensual dribbling out of reforms allowed the French to live in one world and think in another. </seg>
<seg id=417> This is a key reason for the political cataclysm that exploded during the last presidential campaign, when the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the second round of the presidential election, ahead of the incumbent Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin. </seg>
<seg id=418> The rise of the extreme left, which gathered 10% of the vote during that presidential campaign, also attests to this political failure. </seg>
<seg id=419> France needs a political revolution more than an economic one if it is to come to terms with reality, part of which is that "French decline" is a fear of the French people's own making. </seg>
<seg id=420> The Value of European Values </seg>
<seg id=421> Europe's leaders have revived the constitutional talks that broke down last December in a dispute about voting rights. </seg>
<seg id=422> Such disputes are, of course, subject to compromises, which are likely to be found. </seg>
<seg id=423> What still needs to be settled is a clear understanding of what the constitution is meant to achieve. </seg>
<seg id=424> Two fundamental principles have underpinned European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity. </seg>
<seg id=425> Both principles lie at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, and law. </seg>
<seg id=426> For years they have been present in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union - in treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which quotes them in the Preamble), in the recent draft Constitution. </seg>
<seg id=427> They are, in short, inscribed in the EU's history and ideals. </seg>
<seg id=428> But what do solidarity and subsidiarity really mean? </seg>
<seg id=429> Consider solidarity, which is open to at least two interpretations: static solidarity, which concerns only the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, which concerns the production of income and wealth as well. </seg>
<seg id=430> In the postwar history of European integration, dynamic solidarity was strong in the first period - that of the European Coal and Steel Community - both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction) and in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome. </seg>
<seg id=431> This does not mean that dynamic solidarity was subsequently suppressed: European Monetary Union, for example, is an expression of it. </seg>
<seg id=432> Some countries did not immediately benefit from the euro, but accepted it for the sake of solidarity. They were convinced that it would have positive effects in the long run. </seg>
<seg id=433> Dynamic solidarity, in other words, means favoring policies that foster investment, innovation, economic growth, and employment. </seg>
<seg id=434> However, as GDP growth in the EU indicates, dynamic solidarity has been undermined over the last decade. </seg>
<seg id=435> What is particularly worrying is the research and development lag. </seg>
<seg id=436> Realization of the EU's so-called Lisbon strategy, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the world's most competitive economy, is threatened by a growing emphasis on static solidarity, reflected in high social welfare costs and the high taxes needed to finance them. </seg>
<seg id=437> The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population, which, along with slower growth, has led to structural fiscal imbalances. </seg>
<seg id=438> One of the biggest challenges for the future of the EU is addressing today's prevalence of static solidarity oriented towards old people over dynamic solidarity favoring young people. </seg>
<seg id=439> After all, the Union cannot afford to permit current consumption to continue to prevail over the investment needed to ensure future prosperity. </seg>
<seg id=440> Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that it, too, has two interpretations: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity. </seg>
<seg id=441> Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers among different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, national states, regions, and municipalities. </seg>
<seg id=442> The best-known application of this principle is federalism. </seg>
<seg id=443> In the European Treaties, we find a clear expression of vertical subsidiarity. </seg>
<seg id=444> But is this enough to encompass the emerging institutional and constitutional settings of the Union? </seg>
<seg id=445> Horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and freedom of human beings, as well as social and economic powers. </seg>
<seg id=446> It encompasses the relations between state, society, and market. </seg>
<seg id=447> But society and the market have their own rights and sovereignties that are not granted by the state. </seg>
<seg id=448> So the problem comes in assuring the autonomy of each realm. </seg>
<seg id=449> An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the internal European market, which created a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between firms because they are no longer protected by national governments. </seg>
<seg id=450> Horizontal subsidiarity means that in both society and the economic sphere, the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility, which must be respected to the greatest possible extent. </seg>
<seg id=451> It also means that support must be given by a "superior power" whenever individual freedom and responsibility do not suffice to achieve the ends necessary for human dignity. </seg>
<seg id=452> This support, however, should be implemented in ways that the natural potential of individuals, society, and the market is promoted. </seg>
<seg id=453> But that is possible only when the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clearly formulated, which it has not been in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or the work of the European Convention. </seg>
<seg id=454> In short, solidarity has come to mean redistribution rather than growth (which is how today's generation expresses solidarity with respect to future generations), while subsidiarity has come to mean the distribution of political power, rather than a careful delineation of the boundaries between the state, civil society, and the market. </seg>
<seg id=455> Today, both values are defined in ways that favor the state. </seg>
<seg id=456> Indeed, focusing on market-based growth has often been identified with the semi-alien values of America. </seg>
<seg id=457> But these values are deeply ingrained in Europe, and should be brought out again. </seg>
<seg id=458> The EU should restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity that is more balanced in favor of the market and society, and that reduces the state's socio-economic influence. </seg>
<seg id=459> State institutions should deliver public goods (like defense, justice, and fiscal and monetary policy), society should deliver social goods (like culture, education, and assistance to needy people), and the market should deliver economic goods (which are connected with profits, growth, and employment). </seg>
<seg id=460> In the 21st century, Europe must reconsider the value of both principles - solidarity and subsidiarity - if it is to attain integration's historic goal: the freedom and well being needed to overcome the differences and political divisions that incited tragedy in the 20th century. </seg>
<seg id=461> That is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be written. </seg>
<seg id=462> The Politics of Values </seg>
<seg id=463> The debate about the American elections has still not abated. </seg>
<seg id=464> How did President George W. Bush manage to get three million votes more than Senator John Kerry, and, in addition, to have a Republican majority elected in both houses of Congress? </seg>
<seg id=465> There is not much agreement on the answers, but two themes recur in many explanations. </seg>
<seg id=466> One is personality. </seg>
<seg id=467> At a time of uncertainty and threat, people had more confidence in the president they knew than in the candidate who seemed unproven. </seg>
<seg id=468> The second theme is values. </seg>
<seg id=469> People voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies. </seg>
<seg id=470> Indeed, some (it is said) agreed with Kerry's policies but nevertheless gave their vote to Bush, because they felt "at ease" with his general attitudes. </seg>
<seg id=471> Clearly, the United States is now deeply divided in electoral terms. </seg>
<seg id=472> An arch of blue (Democratic) states in the East, North, and West spans a huge red (Republican) area in the middle and the South. </seg>
<seg id=473> More than that, the divisions are reproduced at the local level. </seg>
<seg id=474> Gerrymandering -- the drawing of electoral boundaries to benefit a particular political party -- is no longer necessary. </seg>
<seg id=475> People actually tend to move to areas in which a majority of others share their values, whether Republican or Democratic. </seg>
<seg id=476> What exactly are these values? </seg>
<seg id=477> They have to do, or so we hear, with "god, guns, and gays." </seg>
<seg id=478> Religion plays a part in them, including the literal truth of the bible when it comes to the story of the creation. </seg>
<seg id=479> The possession of a gun is the ultimate test of individualism, and using guns in wars is not abhorrent. </seg>
<seg id=480> Gays and other "modern" practices are rejected as self-indulgent. </seg>
<seg id=481> As the political scientist Andrew Hacker recently put it, "the Bush candidacy was framed to make a majority by giving some 60 million people a chance to feel good about themselves." </seg>
<seg id=482> Is all this an American phenomenon, or are there similar trends elsewhere? </seg>
<seg id=483> One answer is that as an American phenomenon, the politics of values may command a majority now, but it is by no means general. </seg>
<seg id=484> Europe and other parts of the world are equally divided. </seg>
<seg id=485> Personality undoubtedly matters, and beneath overt political differences there may also be issues of values that have not yet come to the fore. </seg>
<seg id=486> But traditional political differences based on disagreement over fundamental values play a diminishing part in elections. </seg>
<seg id=487> For example, Prime Minister Tony Blair, the next major leader to face an election, plays the personality card and talks about policies, but he represents above all a set of middle-class values. </seg>
<seg id=488> When he speaks of "modernization," or of "bringing things into the twenty-first century," he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability. </seg>
<seg id=489> This has left the Conservative opposition without an effective response. </seg>
<seg id=490> Even questions like tax cuts and stricter asylum rules do not quite hit the value chords that the Republican Party in the US has managed to touch. </seg>
<seg id=491> The picture is similar in Germany, where the overt influence of value politics is even smaller. </seg>
<seg id=492> The German debate is still largely a policy debate. </seg>
<seg id=493> When the opposition offers the government talks on health-care reform or, most recently, on combating unemployment, the underlying competition is about competence rather than values. </seg>
<seg id=494> Yet underneath the common battlegrounds of political debate in Britain and Germany and elsewhere in Europe, value clashes are lurking. </seg>
<seg id=495> Parties fight for those who can be made "to feel good about themselves," but they may not fully realize that this is only partly a matter of policy. </seg>
<seg id=496> Religion is not likely to become a major factor in European politics; opinion polls show that religious observance marks one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans. </seg>
<seg id=497> Guns also have a different place in the European mind; it is their absence that most Europeans regard as important. </seg>
<seg id=498> A pacifist streak of values is also unmistakable in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=499> But the issue of political correctness ("gays") plays a so-far underrated part in Europe as well. </seg>
<seg id=500> Most importantly, the Europe itself divides Europeans, as the "national question" arises in each European state. </seg>
<seg id=501> It is an issue of values, inspired by fear. </seg>
<seg id=502> People want to know where they belong, and in the process they turn against the US and toward Europe, or against Europe and toward their country. </seg>
<seg id=503> Either way, we leave the realms of policies, and even of politics, and enter the murky domain of symbols and myth. </seg>
<seg id=504> This, at any rate, is the main risk that democratic countries face, for the politics of values is a dangerous development. </seg>
<seg id=505> It reintroduces fundamental divisions in societies whose greatest democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism from politics. </seg>
<seg id=506> Enlightened public debate must be a dispute about policies contained by a community of values. </seg>
<seg id=507> Insisting on this is therefore a primary objective of the politics of freedom. </seg>
<seg id=508> The Coming Age of Interest </seg>
<seg id=509> One swallow does not make a summer, and one month of normal job growth, and rising prices in the United States does not mean that the Federal Reserve no longer fears economic malaise and deflation. </seg>
<seg id=510> But the time will come when world interest rates begin to rise, as central bankers prepare to resist the upward creep of inflation. </seg>
<seg id=511> Whenever that moment arrives - whether this fall, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007 - America and the global economy will face financial vulnerabilities that reflect the success of the past three years of monetary stimulation in stemming declines in production and moderating unemployment. </seg>
<seg id=512> Short-term interest rates are astonishingly low: only 2% in the euro zone, just 1% in the US, and zero in Japan. </seg>
<seg id=513> Expansionary monetary policy has been successful, but only by pushing interest rates to historic lows - and by convincing investors that borrowing costs will remain at their current levels for a long time. </seg>
<seg id=514> The main result of monetary stimulus has been to boost asset prices: anything that pays a yield, a dividend, or a rent becomes much more attractive - and hence much more valuable in money terms - when interest rates are very low and expected to stay very low. </seg>
<seg id=515> This explains the large gaps between current prices for real estate in the US, equities in New York, London, and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds everywhere and what one would conventionally think their fundamental values should be. </seg>
<seg id=516> So what will happen when central banks start raising interest rates? </seg>
<seg id=517> In 1994, rising short-term rates caused increases in long-term rates - and declines in long-term bond prices - that were at least double what standard models at the time were predicting. </seg>
<seg id=518> Moreover, interest rates in the world's peripheral, developing economies rose far more than rates in the advanced industrial core. </seg>
<seg id=519> Thus, the first danger to worry about for 2005 and beyond - when world interest rates will most likely rise - is another wave of emerging-market financial crises. </seg>
<seg id=520> For countries like Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, the record of the 1990's demonstrates that interest-rate spreads can widen and capital flows reverse remarkably rapidly, regardless of how favorably IMF officials and analyses by major banks view a country's policies. </seg>
<seg id=521> Emerging-market interest-rate spreads now are abnormally low. </seg>
<seg id=522> International money flows - aside from inflows into the US - are not yet at levels associated with "irrational exuberance," but there is still time for that to happen before interest rates start to rise. </seg>
<seg id=523> This is an alarming prospect, because if there is one lesson from the 1990's, it is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows. </seg>
<seg id=524> The second danger springs from high asset values within the advanced industrial core. </seg>
<seg id=525> The dominant mode of thought within the Federal Reserve - with which I agree - appears to be that the information-technology revolution is continuing, that the pace of growth of potential output in the US remains very fast, and that the output gap is thus relatively wide. </seg>
<seg id=526> This implies that interest rates may, in fact, need to stay low for a very considerable period. </seg>
<seg id=527> Moreover, confidence in the Federal Reserve is high, and the last remnants of the 1970's inflation risk premium have been wrung out of interest rates. </seg>
<seg id=528> As a result, even after output levels return to their potential, interest rates will stay low by the standards of the 1980's and the 1990's. </seg>
<seg id=529> All of this is, of course, good news for those who own assets like long-term bonds, stocks, and real estate. </seg>
<seg id=530> Indeed, elevating long-term asset prices was precisely the point of lowering interest rates: making bondholders and especially real estate owners richer, after all, provides a fillip to spending. </seg>
<seg id=531> But the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for a while, they will not stay this low indefinitely. </seg>
<seg id=532> The bottom line is that when interest rates rise, asset values will fall. </seg>
<seg id=533> It is during such periods - particularly when asset values fall swiftly and substantially - that we discover exactly how good our central bankers are at their main job: reducing financial volatility and promoting economic stability. </seg>
<seg id=534> It is also during such periods that we discover how many people who are holding long-term bonds, real estate, or stocks are doing so not because they think current prices are attractive relative to fundamentals, but because their prices have gone up over the past several years. </seg>
<seg id=535> This is a crucial question for policy makers, because those who bought long-term assets due to what seemed like perpetually rising prices are also those who will sell as soon as price trends seem to be reversing. </seg>
<seg id=536> In particular, the US trade deficit looms as a massive source of instability should long-term asset prices fall significantly. </seg>
<seg id=537> To be sure, the challenges facing the world's economic policy makers during the next several years will be different from those that they have faced since the collapse of the NASDAQ bubble. </seg>
<seg id=538> The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by collapsing output and the threat of deflation. </seg>
<seg id=539> But, as we learned in the 1990's, this does not mean that the coming challenges will be easier to handle. </seg>
<seg id=540> America's Opposing Futures </seg>
<seg id=541> I recently learned something interesting: American international finance economists and American domestically oriented macroeconomists have very different -- indeed, opposing -- views of the likely consequences of America's huge current-account deficit. </seg>
<seg id=542> International finance economists see a financial crisis as likely, followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the United States. </seg>
<seg id=543> Domestically oriented macroeconomists, by contrast, see a forthcoming fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis, but as an opportunity to accelerate growth. </seg>
<seg id=544> Domestically oriented macroeconomists look at the situation roughly like this: at some point in the future, foreign central banks will become less willing to continue buying massive amounts of dollar-denominated securities in order to prop up the greenback. </seg>
<seg id=545> When they cease their large-scale dollar-purchase programs, the value of the dollar will fall -- and it will fall hard. </seg>
<seg id=546> But, according to this view, as the dollar's value declines, US exports will become more attractive to foreigners and American employment will rise, with labor re-allocated to the newly-vibrant export sector. </seg>
<seg id=547> It will be like what happened in Britain after it abandoned its exchange-rate peg and allowed the pound to depreciate relative to the Deutschmark , or what happened in the US in the late 1980's, when the dollar depreciated against the pound, the Deutschmark , and -- most importantly -- the Japanese yen. </seg>
<seg id=548> International finance economists see a far bleaker future. </seg>
<seg id=549> They see the end of large-scale dollar-purchase programs by central banks leading not only to a decline in the dollar, but also to a spike in US long-term interest rates, which will curb consumption spending immediately and throttle investment spending after only a short lag. </seg>
<seg id=550> To be sure, international finance economists also see US exports benefiting as the value of the dollar declines, but the lags in demand are such that the export boost will come a year or two after the decline in consumption and investment spending. </seg>
<seg id=551> Eight to ten million people will have to shift employment from services and construction into exports and import-competing goods, implying that structural unemployment will rise. </seg>
<seg id=552> Moreover, there may be a financial panic: large financial institutions with short-term liabilities and long-term assets will have a difficult time weathering a large rise in long-term dollar-denominated interest rates. </seg>
<seg id=553> This mismatch can cause financial stress and bankruptcy just as easily as banks' local-currency assets and dollar liabilities caused stress and bankruptcy in the Mexican and East Asian crises of the 1990's and in the Argentinean crisis of this decade. </seg>
<seg id=554> When international finance economists sketch this scenario, domestically oriented macroeconomists respond that it sounds like a case of incompetent monetary policy. </seg>
<seg id=555> Why should the Federal Reserve allow long-term interest rates to spike just because other central banks have ceased their dollar-purchase programs? </seg>
<seg id=556> Should not the Fed step in and replace them with its own purchases of long-term US Treasury bonds, thereby keeping long-term interest rates at a level conducive to full employment? </seg>
<seg id=557> To this, international finance economists respond that the Fed does not have the power to do so. </seg>
<seg id=558> When forced to choose between full employment and price stability, the international finance economists say that the Fed will choose price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970's, when inflation ran rampant, remains very strong. </seg>
<seg id=559> Therefore, since a fall in the value of the dollar raises import prices, and thus functions as a negative shock to the supply side of the economy, the Fed will have to raise, not lower, interest rates, and sell, not buy, bonds. </seg>
<seg id=560> Serious economists whom I respect enormously find themselves taking strong positions on opposite sides of this debate. </seg>
<seg id=561> I'm not wise enough to say which side is right, but I certainly know which side I hope is wrong. </seg>
<seg id=562> Europe's Free Riders </seg>
<seg id=563> In the United States, individual states that follow unsound fiscal policies face a penalty. </seg>
<seg id=564> Their bonds sell at a discount relative to those of better-managed individual states. </seg>
<seg id=565> The higher debt service they must pay serves -- to some degree -- as a form of discipline against the temptation to spend now and pay later. </seg>
<seg id=566> Of course, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market does not "see" implicit future liabilities (like promised pension payments) to any great degree. </seg>
<seg id=567> Nevertheless, this enforced fiscal discipline, combined with individual states' own internal budgetary procedures, has prevented a large scale state-level fiscal crisis from occurring in the US since the Great Depression. </seg>
<seg id=568> Let us now turn to Europe. </seg>
<seg id=569> Before the advent of the euro, there were many fiscal crises in individual nation-states in southern Europe, which produced waves of high inflation. </seg>
<seg id=570> But, with the single currency in place, the road to solving a fiscal crisis through inflation has been closed, as the European Central Bank (ECB) now stands watch over monetary policy. </seg>
<seg id=571> Nevertheless, even with nation-states no longer able to rely on inflation to solve their unbalanced finances, the single currency allows them to use the debt capacity properly belonging to other members of the European Union to extend their spending sprees and postpone political accountability for periods of laissez les bons temps roulés. </seg>
<seg id=572> To head off this possibility, the EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: government deficits had to be less than 3% of GDP. </seg>
<seg id=573> Last week, the government of Germany -- once the most fiscally prudent and disciplined EU country -- broke the pact's rules for fiscal discipline for the fifth consecutive year, and did so without (much) apology. </seg>
<seg id=574> Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck signaled that he expected the European Commission to apply some sanctions to Germany: the credibility of the pact would, he said, be at stake if no action were taken. </seg>
<seg id=575> Thus, Germany would not block sanctions this time, as it did two and a half years ago. </seg>
<seg id=576> But Steinbrueck also made it clear that he expects any sanctions in response to Germany's predicted 3.4%-of-GDP fiscal deficit to be largely symbolic, not penalties that would cost its government or economy anything of significance. </seg>
<seg id=577> The Stability and Growth Pact is not -- or is not yet -- working anywhere near the way it was intended to work. </seg>
<seg id=578> What about market discipline? </seg>
<seg id=579> Is the German government's willingness to issue more debt and run bigger deficits limited because the market recognizes and penalizes nation states that allow their fiscal positions to weaken? </seg>
<seg id=580> In a word, no. </seg>
<seg id=581> The interest rates on the euro-denominated sovereign debt of the twelve euro-zone governments are all very similar. </seg>
<seg id=582> So the market does not seem to care that countries have different potentials to generate exports to fund the financial flows needed for debt repayments, or different current and projected debt-to-GDP ratios. </seg>
<seg id=583> Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert of the University of London believe that it is the ECB's willingness to, in effect, accept all euro-zone debt as collateral that has undermined the market's willingness to be an enforcer of fiscal prudence. </seg>
<seg id=584> As long as the marginal piece of German debt is used as collateral for a short-term loan or as the centerpiece of a repurchase agreement to gain liquidity, its value is much more likely to be determined by the terms on which the ECB accepts it as collateral than by its fundamentals. </seg>
<seg id=585> The ECB's treatment of all such debt as equally powerful sources of back-up liquidity now trumps any analysis of differences in long-term sovereign risk. </seg>
<seg id=586> In the long run, this is dangerous. </seg>
<seg id=587> Both market discipline and sound fiscal management are needed to create a reasonable chance of long-run price stability. </seg>
<seg id=588> Omit either a market penalty now for behavior that may become reckless or the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations, and you run grave risks -- perhaps not today or tomorrow, but someday, and for the rest of your life. </seg>
<seg id=589> As time passes, the coming of the single currency and the way that the euro has been implemented is generating more and more unease. </seg>
<seg id=590> Policy as a whole over the entire euro zone is too deflationary. </seg>
<seg id=591> The necessary transfers are not being made to make the common currency bearable to regions that lose out and are already in recession when the ECB tightens policy. </seg>
<seg id=592> The institutional foundations of stable long-run fiscal policy are being eroded. </seg>
<seg id=593> And now, Buiter and Sibert argue convincingly, the ECB is giving the market less scope to reward the thrifty and penalize the profligate than it should. </seg>
<seg id=594> There is no movement of the soil yet, and there will not be for some time. </seg>
<seg id=595> But the ground under the euro may well begin to shift if things don't change. </seg>
<seg id=596> Milosevic and Hussein: Trial by Farce </seg>
<seg id=597> Trials of war criminals were once serious business. </seg>
<seg id=598> Recall the photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess sitting glumly in the dock at Nuremberg. </seg>
<seg id=599> Some Nazi leaders were even hanged after relatively short but fair trials. </seg>
<seg id=600> Nowadays, legal proceedings against the world's most wicked leaders have become farce. </seg>
<seg id=601> The trial of Saddam Hussein and his Ba'athist cronies offers an ongoing series of embarrassments. </seg>
<seg id=602> The defendants try one antic after another, and Hussein shows every form of contempt possible except "mooning" the judge. </seg>
<seg id=603> It is hard to expect an outcome that will appear legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world. </seg>
<seg id=604> Meanwhile, Slobodan Milosevic's trial morphed into a funeral after four boring years of testimony and a sunken cost of more than $200 million. </seg>
<seg id=605> In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have dickered for almost a decade about how to bring surviving Khmer Rouge figures to trial. </seg>
<seg id=606> The mass killers who took power in the twentieth century were doomed to being killed in popular revolts or to being tried for their crimes -- that is, if they did not die in power. </seg>
<seg id=607> Who can be proud that Romania's last Communist boss, Nicolai Ceaucescu, and his wife were shot without even the semblance of a fair trial? </seg>
<seg id=608> The formal trappings of a real court always seem better than instant justice, even if the end result is also death. </seg>
<seg id=609> Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant. </seg>
<seg id=610> A nation could put its own former leaders on trial, as the Argentines did in the 1980's with the generals responsible for the disappearance of more than 5,000 fellow citizens. </seg>
<seg id=611> At the international level, the Nuremberg model remains available to generate further trials, though under the dubious conditions that victorious powers sometimes impose liability for crimes, such as "crimes against humanity" that were are not properly defined at the time they are committed. </seg>
<seg id=612> There was a time when we could see the advantages of both national and international trials. </seg>
<seg id=613> Home grown trials enabled the local community to work out its grief by participating closely in the process. </seg>
<seg id=614> As judges and juries, the defendant's compatriots could also bring greater sensitivity to the assessment of guilt because they appreciated the tough conditions under which a deposed dictator made his decisions. </seg>
<seg id=615> Argentina's trial of the generals was a successful ritual in the painstaking transition from military junta to democracy, but the experience ended with weeping self-doubt. </seg>
<seg id=616> Even after conviction, the generals were sufficiently strong to exact a termination of the trials and then a pardon from the succeeding president. </seg>
<seg id=617> Argentine politics is still embroiled in the legal consequences of those trials of 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id=618> At the international level, the UN Security Council's decision to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was also greeted with great confidence. </seg>
<seg id=619> The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese. </seg>
<seg id=620> But then the judges had the misfortune of realizing their fondest dream -- trying in their court the arch-villain Slobodan Milosevic. </seg>
<seg id=621> It is not clear how the Serbs would have handled Milosevic in a local trial. </seg>
<seg id=622> A lot would have depended on the political party that controlled the court. </seg>
<seg id=623> At the international level, the fear was not of too much politics but of too much law. </seg>
<seg id=624> Milosevic's trial had to be more than fair, it had to be an emblem of UN Justice. </seg>
<seg id=625> Thus Milosevic was allowed to defend himself -- a huge mistake in terms of the trial's length and efficiency. </seg>
<seg id=626> There was no limit on the number of witnesses the prosecution called to testify about the same gruesome story of Serbian aggression and brutality. </seg>
<seg id=627> It will take many months to determine what went wrong and why the trial lasted a scandalous four years. </seg>
<seg id=628> My hunch is that the court's well-meaning officials were too influenced by the South African Peace and Reconciliation Commission, a model touted in law schools as the desired alternative to retributive justice. </seg>
<seg id=629> In the South African proceedings the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims. </seg>
<seg id=630> Every victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant listened. </seg>
<seg id=631> In the case of massacres endured in the twentieth century, such storytelling can last decades. </seg>
<seg id=632> Encouraging victims to speak and then giving the defendant the right to filibuster the proceedings by touting his merits as a political leader amounts to a formula for infinite delay. </seg>
<seg id=633> One lesson we have learned from both the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that one should not put men or women on trial in order to terminate their charismatic appeal. </seg>
<seg id=634> They will turn the trial around -- particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves -- and use the courtroom to vindicate their careers. </seg>
<seg id=635> Tyrants should be tried only after they are clearly defeated. </seg>
<seg id=636> Ironically, it was an advantage of the Nuremberg courts that they were staffed by the representatives of the victorious powers. </seg>
<seg id=637> They were a constant reminder to Goering, Hess, and their henchmen that the Allies were in charge, that the Nazis were irreversibly defeated. </seg>
<seg id=638> Punishing the guilty, rather than shaping the way history would be written, was always the clear objective of the trial. </seg>
<seg id=639> The tragedy of the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that the "i"s of history were not yet fully dotted and history itself was on trial. </seg>
<seg id=640> The resulting hesitancy of those in charge gave rise to procedures -- both international and national -- that facilitated fantasies of vindication and return. </seg>
<seg id=641> In the case of Hussein, that fantasy may yet become real. </seg>
<seg id=642> Iraq's Economic Divide </seg>
<seg id=643> Everyone who looks at Iraq sees a nation divided between Shia, Sunni, and Kurd communities. </seg>
<seg id=644> But an equally fundamental division -- one that has contributed as much to the ongoing insurrection as sectarian strife and opposition to the American-led military occupation -- is the widening gap between Iraq's rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id=645> When Iraq was liberated, most people, especially the poor, began to hope for a charismatic leader who would save them from the bitter reality of daily life. </seg>
<seg id=646> Raised in fear, they had no idea how democracy could apply to their society, or how human-rights groups and other civic organizations could help shape the future. </seg>
<seg id=647> Soon enough, Iraq was faced with a new social divide. </seg>
<seg id=648> On one side stood people who understood how to operate in a democracy, attain power, and realize their ambitions. </seg>
<seg id=649> They learned to speak the language of democracy, gaining money and influence in the process and enlisting independent organizations to defend their rights and privileges. </seg>
<seg id=650> On the other side, however, remains the vast population of powerless Iraqis, including widows and divorced or abandoned women with no one to provide for them and their children. </seg>
<seg id=651> For these people, democracy and human rights mean nothing. </seg>
<seg id=652> They are ignorant, poor, and sick. </seg>
<seg id=653> Victimized by an educational system that collapsed over a decade ago, they have few skills that can help them find employment in Iraq's blighted economy. </seg>
<seg id=654> During Saddam's reign, no effort was made to raise living standards for the poor. </seg>
<seg id=655> I have visited the huge slums of Iraq and found families living in homes with barely a roof to cover them, with infestations of insects everywhere, and with raw sewage seeping under their doors. </seg>
<seg id=656> Day or night, they live in darkness. </seg>
<seg id=657> Needing nothing more than food, decent housing, and the possibility of a job, these families wait for death, dreading the cries of their starving children. </seg>
<seg id=658> When I met the women who live in those houses, they showered me with questions: will democracy give us food and houses? </seg>
<seg id=659> Will democracy stop men from beating their wives? </seg>
<seg id=660> Will it give citizenship to our children? </seg>
<seg id=661> Will it give us the right to divorce the husbands who abandon us? </seg>
<seg id=662> My answer to all of these questions was "yes." </seg>
<seg id=663> Yes, democracy will give you the right to live in a decent house, the right to learn and work, and it will give citizenship to your children and make you equal with your men. </seg>
<seg id=664> But you have to work hard and make every possible effort in demanding your rights. </seg>
<seg id=665> They replied: "Saddam taught us for 35 years how to be jobless, silent, and fearful. </seg>
<seg id=666> What can we do now?" </seg>
<seg id=667> In these destitute areas, where most Iraqis live, people are prey to bitter temptations. </seg>
<seg id=668> Many are beyond the reach of political or government leaders. </seg>
<seg id=669> They fall easily into violence, theft, and sabotage. </seg>
<seg id=670> Poverty drives some to take money in exchange for acts of violence, abetted by the lure of a false heroism that they were not able to act upon during Saddam's long reign. </seg>
<seg id=671> Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of Iraq's violent history of wars and atrocities, which has desensitized people to killing. </seg>
<seg id=672> Though conditions in Iraq today are drawing many young men toward violence, I am convinced that we need only to provide decent jobs and housing to save them. </seg>
<seg id=673> Jobs, in particular, will help young people to create new lives through serious work. </seg>
<seg id=674> We must not use no-work jobs to disguise an army of unemployed. </seg>
<seg id=675> We must give people jobs that allow them to make a contribution to rebuilding the country. </seg>
<seg id=676> By nature, every individual seeks to prove himself as a useful person in his or her society. </seg>
<seg id=677> But the culture that Saddam created convinced Iraqis that political connections are the only way to gain authority, money, and knowledge. </seg>
<seg id=678> Overcoming such sentiments will take time and a vibrant economy, which means that a new Iraqi government must have limited power, allowing the private sector to grow while encouraging widespread understanding of democracy and human rights. </seg>
<seg id=679> Religious groups are ready to contribute to this process. </seg>
<seg id=680> We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they, too, have a chance to serve their country. </seg>
<seg id=681> Last but not least, we must provide loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life. </seg>
<seg id=682> Above all, the government must spare no effort in convincing poor Iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom, and how important the constitution is in realizing their aspirations for a better life. </seg>
<seg id=683> This will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people consider breaking the law an act of heroism. </seg>
<seg id=684> But we Iraqis have also learned that power should not be concentrated in a few hands, and that establishing justice requires fighting all forms of corruption. </seg>
<seg id=685> If the constitution is to operate as the guarantee of democracy, freedom, and security, poor Iraqis must learn to make that fight their own. </seg>
<seg id=686> The Islamist Identity </seg>
<seg id=687> Everywhere you look nowadays, Islam is used (and misused) as a political force. </seg>
<seg id=688> Some Muslims employ it as a call to action; many in the West (and elsewhere) perceive it as an "other" demanding containment and exclusion. </seg>
<seg id=689> As a Turk, I feel both sides of this debate directly. </seg>
<seg id=690> The reason that Islam seems like a religion of the "other" to Western eyes is that the West has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalization of religion. </seg>
<seg id=691> It is not religion that disappeared from modern Western life, of course, but rather the claims that religious institutions can make on individual behavior. </seg>
<seg id=692> Religion in the modern world is a much more personal and spiritual experience than ever before. </seg>
<seg id=693> Yet a process of de-institutionalization of religious experience is also taking place within Islam. </seg>
<seg id=694> Politicization of Islam is displacing the authority of Islam's religious classes, the ulema . </seg>
<seg id=695> As in the West, Islamic religious experience is becoming more personal. </seg>
<seg id=696> Interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including political militants, intellectuals and women, is one result. </seg>
<seg id=697> Another is the vulgarization of religious knowledge, with the Koran's teachings abused and taken out of context to support political ends. </seg>
<seg id=698> Who now decides what is legitimate and what is illicit in Islam? </seg>
<seg id=699> Who has the authority to interpret religious texts? </seg>
<seg id=700> Who can issue a "fatwa" or declare "jihad"? </seg>
<seg id=701> Nowadays, activism and terrorism provide, or rather impose, a new source of legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id=702> So lay people decide what Islam does and does not mean, without the authority of religious schools and specialized training. </seg>
<seg id=703> Indeed, Islam today is primarily interpreted through political actors and cultural movements, not religious institutions. </seg>
<seg id=704> This de-institutionalization has enabled Islam to move from being a local and national social bond to forging imaginary ties between all Muslims, everywhere, who feel oppressed or displaced. </seg>
<seg id=705> Thus, Islamism can unite adherents who previously were deeply divided: spiritual Sufi and canonized Shariat Muslims; Shia and Sunni Muslims; conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran. </seg>
<seg id=706> At the same time, Islam is on the move, with its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including the cities of the West. </seg>
<seg id=707> Many see this movement as something negative, emphasizing the fact that these people are socially uprooted, which leads to alienation and, for some, to terrorism. </seg>
<seg id=708> But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern outlook. </seg>
<seg id=709> Of course, through migration Muslims experience a sense of distancing, if not an outright break, from their social origins. </seg>
<seg id=710> So their religious experience is of a new kind, bereft of theological, community, or state institutions. </seg>
<seg id=711> Religious experience instead becomes a form of social imagination within which they reconstruct a sense of belonging to Islam in new and strange surroundings. </seg>
<seg id=712> It is not distance from modern life, but proximity to it that triggers a return to religious identity. </seg>
<seg id=713> Indeed, most radicalism arises in groups who, by their experience of mobility and displacement, are acquainted with secular Western ways of political thinking and urban living. </seg>
<seg id=714> Disoriented by unfamiliar surroundings, Islam becomes their anchor. </seg>
<seg id=715> But for this anchor to work, Islam must be liberated from its traditionally subservient, passive and docile posture in the face of modernity. </seg>
<seg id=716> By wearing a veil or beard, claiming the right for places to pray at work or school, and demanding special foods, Muslims identify themselves overtly as Muslims. </seg>
<seg id=717> They are telling everyone around them that they are more zealous and meticulous in their religious observance than those who confine their religiosity to private life. </seg>
<seg id=718> For example, non-Muslims usually see veiling as a sign of the debasement and inferiority of Muslim women. </seg>
<seg id=719> From a stigma, however, it has become for Muslims a sign of their positive affirmation of an Islamic identity. </seg>
<seg id=720> Young Muslim women in Europe illustrate this transformation perfectly. </seg>
<seg id=721> Girls who adopt the headscarf in French and German schools are closer in many respects (namely youth culture, fashion consciousness, and language) to their classmates than to their homebound, uneducated mothers. </seg>
<seg id=722> In adopting the headscarf for Europe's public sphere, these girls are unintentionally altering the symbol and the role of Muslim women. </seg>
<seg id=723> This tendency extends deeper than headscarves. </seg>
<seg id=724> All Western Muslims possess a double sense of belonging, a double cultural capital. </seg>
<seg id=725> They define themselves through their religiosity, but they also have gained universal, secular knowledge. </seg>
<seg id=726> Because they have a double cultural capital, they can circulate relatively freely between different activities and spaces--home, school, youth associations, and urban leisure space. </seg>
<seg id=727> Being a Muslim and being an Islamist are not the same thing. </seg>
<seg id=728> What we are witnessing today is a shift from a Muslim identity to an Islamist identity. </seg>
<seg id=729> The religious self for individual Muslims is being shifted from the private to the public realm. </seg>
<seg id=730> The question for everyone is whether that search for identity can be satisfied with headscarves and wide public acceptance of Islamic religious practice, or if positive affirmation of Islam demands a more fundamental renunciation of modernity. </seg>
<seg id=731> A New Era for Islamic Science? </seg>
<seg id=732> For a few hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world stood out. </seg>
<seg id=733> Masters of these disciplines were revered there, medicine advanced quickly, and the average person was curious about how nature worked. </seg>
<seg id=734> Not surprisingly, this region was globally respected. </seg>
<seg id=735> In the other half of the known planet, scientists were punished, even killed. </seg>
<seg id=736> Mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien, and was later made subservient to religion. </seg>
<seg id=737> The standard of living was low. </seg>
<seg id=738> The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor. </seg>
<seg id=739> Both regions were religiously governed (historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them. </seg>
<seg id=740> Now, of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed. </seg>
<seg id=741> Since World War II, the United States has been the world's undisputed leader in science. </seg>
<seg id=742> Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands, attracted by superior research universities and opportunities. </seg>
<seg id=743> Until recently, more than half of all mathematics, science, and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born. </seg>
<seg id=744> Many of these talents stayed after graduation, and both industry and government took advantage of this. </seg>
<seg id=745> Meanwhile, Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed. </seg>
<seg id=746> Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have. </seg>
<seg id=747> Recently, a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions. </seg>
<seg id=748> But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old. </seg>
<seg id=749> More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries. </seg>
<seg id=750> Imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research. </seg>
<seg id=751> Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS? </seg>
<seg id=752> This is one unclaimed opportunity. </seg>
<seg id=753> But another exists, and not just for Islamic societies. </seg>
<seg id=754> The US has made profound missteps recently. </seg>
<seg id=755> "Matters of faith" have been substituted for science across government, from the president down. </seg>
<seg id=756> Top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief. </seg>
<seg id=757> Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration, school systems are shifting their focus from science to "values." </seg>
<seg id=758> Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities. </seg>
<seg id=759> Major scientific organizations have protested, without result. </seg>
<seg id=760> At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term, discouraging long-term investment in research. </seg>
<seg id=761> Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years. </seg>
<seg id=762> Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global research dominance. </seg>
<seg id=763> Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980's. </seg>
<seg id=764> Japan's chief industrialist, Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book called The Japan that Can Say No . </seg>
<seg id=765> They outlined a national strategy in which world influence was understood to flow from scientific leadership. </seg>
<seg id=766> The key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the "food chain" of military technologies was controlled by other nations. </seg>
<seg id=767> The book's title refers to Japan's plan to "say no" to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies. </seg>
<seg id=768> Building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible. </seg>
<seg id=769> For example, Texas, like most southern US states, was once economically poor and declining. </seg>
<seg id=770> Although it had oil revenue, the flow of dollars into an economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think. </seg>
<seg id=771> So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment. </seg>
<seg id=772> Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities. </seg>
<seg id=773> The effect has been staggering: aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California, but is booming in Texas. </seg>
<seg id=774> Telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas, even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel. </seg>
<seg id=775> Although manufacturing in the US is in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world. </seg>
<seg id=776> There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=777> First, however, the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage. </seg>
<seg id=778> Iran's Debate Over Iraq </seg>
<seg id=779> No country in the Middle East is monitoring postwar events in Iraq more closely than Iran. </seg>
<seg id=780> Geographical proximity, an intense and bloody history of conflict with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional connections to Shi'a Iraq, and concerns about the United States and its policies in the region are all threads that tie Iran to its western neighbor. </seg>
<seg id=781> Given ongoing tensions with America, Iran is particularly concerned with the likelihood of a continuing US presence next door, as well as with America's dominant role in shaping Iraq's post-Saddam future. </seg>
<seg id=782> Outsiders may find it difficult to follow internal Iranian debates, but they do exist, and they are intense, even if they are not always visible to the wider international public. </seg>
<seg id=783> Three general approaches are recognizable in the evolving Iranian debate on post-Saddam Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=784> Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran must inevitably cooperate with the US in post-Saddam Iraq, if only to ensure the rights of Iraq's Shi'a population. </seg>
<seg id=785> For this reason, Iran should win assurances that a new leadership in Iraq will not be hostile to it, and will seek friendly bilateral relations. </seg>
<seg id=786> Other vital considerations for the pragmatists include preserving Iraq's territorial integrity and repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran. </seg>
<seg id=787> These moderates think that Iran's government should press America for extradition of Iraq-based members of the Mujahdin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), as well as its total dismantling. </seg>
<seg id=788> In exchange, Iran's government should give its support to ensuring peace, stability, and security in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=789> In sum, the pragmatists would limit Iranian-American dealings, keeping them focused on an agenda that largely reflects Iran's domestic concerns. </seg>
<seg id=790> By and large, conservative forces in Iran support this approach. </seg>
<seg id=791> Another approach envisions a more active, cooperative Iranian role in reconstructing Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=792> Advocates of this view argue that Iran is well positioned to make rebuilding easier, owing to its well-established infrastructure of personal and institutional ties in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=793> Eventually, it is argued, the US and the international community will recognize the value of Iranian cooperation. </seg>
<seg id=794> Iranian cooperation should be repaid with the dismantling of the MKO infrastructure in Iraq, perhaps linked to an Iranian commitment to crack down further on any al-Qaida activities, as well as expel al-Qaida members from Iran. </seg>
<seg id=795> Most importantly, Iran ought to press for an American assurance that its cooperation will be reciprocated by an American guarantee that Iran will not be a target of American military action in the future. </seg>
<seg id=796> In short, advocates of cooperation call for an open and explicit bargain: Iran's support for stability during the current transitional phase in Iraq, as well as its commitment to maintain cooperative relations with whatever permanent government emerges in Iraq, in exchange for an improvement in Iran's regional and international position. </seg>
<seg id=797> This view is widely held among Iran's reformers--both inside and outside government--and the more internationally minded technocratic and business class. </seg>
<seg id=798> Finally, for Iran's radicals, the possibility of cooperative relations with the US is pure fantasy. </seg>
<seg id=799> They believe that America is bent on undermining Iran's security and compromising its national interests. </seg>
<seg id=800> In the radicals' view, the US will at the very least seek to dictate major changes in Iranian foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=801> At most, they argue, America will actively push for regime change in Iran. </seg>
<seg id=802> It will actively work against Iran's acquisition of nuclear knowledge and energy, and may yet attempt to weaken Iran's military capability altogether. </seg>
<seg id=803> These radicals view the US invasion of Iraq as reflecting America's desire to encircle Iran. </seg>
<seg id=804> In response, they believe that Iran must be aggressive in defending its interests, forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers, and using Iran's influence in Iraq to prevent a pro-American, anti-Iran government from emerging in Baghdad. </seg>
<seg id=805> Hardliners of all factions support this approach. </seg>
<seg id=806> Overthrowing Saddam's regime was the easy part of the Iraqi crisis. </seg>
<seg id=807> Now comes the hard part: establishing peace and security, winning the war on terrorism, and convincing the Muslim masses that America is not intent on occupying Iraq, siphoning off its oil, and reshaping the Middle East in its image. </seg>
<seg id=808> In the meantime, opposition to the US, expressed as suicide bombing and other forms of terrorism, will very likely increase. </seg>
<seg id=809> Iran is destined to remain a major regional player because its political dynamism and Muslim identity resonate widely in the Muslim world. </seg>
<seg id=810> What happens in Iraq has major implications for Iran, and the US is well advised to find ways of recognizing this fact. </seg>
<seg id=811> American threats, or talk of another war, fuel the fires of resentment and frustration in Iran, strengthening the most radical forces. </seg>
<seg id=812> If the US wishes to avoid this outcome, it must consider limiting the influence of its own radicals, recognizing that America's interests in Iraq are best served by greater cooperation with Iran. </seg>
<seg id=813> The Way Out of Iraq </seg>
<seg id=814> At last the point has been reached in Iraq where everyone ostensibly wants the same thing: the departure of Coalition forces from the country. </seg>
<seg id=815> The recent leak from Britain's Ministry of Defense of a discussion paper on troop withdrawal highlights this desire. </seg>
<seg id=816> The only question is how to satisfy it. </seg>
<seg id=817> As long as the Coalition forces stay, violence is likely to escalate. </seg>
<seg id=818> But if they leave, it will also escalate, only faster. </seg>
<seg id=819> So the real question is how to get to the point where Iraq has a police force and army that can be trusted to maintain law as well as order. </seg>
<seg id=820> Much ground must be covered to get anywhere close. </seg>
<seg id=821> Notwithstanding the courage of the many Iraqis who join either the army or the police, no one should be surprised if some have motives that are less than pure. </seg>
<seg id=822> In northern Iraq, old scores are being settled and de facto ethnic segregation is being introduced in areas, such as Irbil, that were traditionally diverse. </seg>
<seg id=823> In other areas, sharia law is being introduced by force. </seg>
<seg id=824> So how can Iraq create uniformed services that can be trusted to enforce the law effectively and impartially, without consideration of ethnicity, religion and gender? </seg>
<seg id=825> The traditional answer is to recruit, train, and instill the "right values." </seg>
<seg id=826> But there is not enough time for that. </seg>
<seg id=827> Other ways are needed. </seg>
<seg id=828> In the absence of a deeply instilled value system, Iraq needs grassroots civil society organizations that will hold police and army to account. </seg>
<seg id=829> These could take different forms, but what is important is that they are truly inclusive at a local level, and that they get support from district, regional, and national power structures when they highlight abuses. </seg>
<seg id=830> If there is local scrutiny, and national reinforcement and recognition of the value of that scrutiny, then most members of the uniformed forces are likely to behave appropriately -- and can be more easily identified and dealt with if they don't. </seg>
<seg id=831> This might appear excessively hopeful, yet in Afghanistan, a country akin to Iraq in many ways, there are groups working towards this goal. </seg>
<seg id=832> The Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) provides a model of how this can be done. </seg>
<seg id=833> In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, ordinary people's highest priority has been to achieve a reduction in violence. </seg>
<seg id=834> CPAU worked across the country in the last three years to set up District level Peace Committees, supported by satellite Peace Councils in villages. </seg>
<seg id=835> The initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children once learned arithmetic by counting numbers of dead Soviet soldiers. </seg>
<seg id=836> The Committees therefore seek to bring together all sections of the community -- including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges, and businesspeople -- to develop ways of resolving conflicts non-violently. </seg>
<seg id=837> Although monitoring has not been a formal part of the role of the committees until now (it is planned for the future), the mere fact that the police, army, and judiciary are part of these committees brings them into contact with the rest of the community, provides feedback, and starts to build trust. </seg>
<seg id=838> Some results are remarkable. </seg>
<seg id=839> In one workshop, the local military commander came for a couple of hours, as a courtesy, and ended up staying for the whole week. </seg>
<seg id=840> At the end, he apologized for his violent past and made a commitment to disarm his 2,000-strong private army. </seg>
<seg id=841> He now visits the Committee offices regularly. </seg>
<seg id=842> In Iraq, projects such as the Humanitarian Liaison Center in Kirkuk are starting to fulfill a monitoring function by offering the ethnically diverse local population the opportunity to bring grievances and get help in having them resolved. </seg>
<seg id=843> But, too often, even if a court ruling is made, it is not enforced as a result of intimidation. </seg>
<seg id=844> Much good work on strengthening civil society has already been done by American and British forces. </seg>
<seg id=845> We don't hear about the workshops for women's empowerment, or the successful organization of small-scale local elections across the country.   </seg>
<seg id=846> But mobilizing civil society is hugely challenging, particularly when, as in Iraq, it needs to be done quickly and on a large scale. </seg>
<seg id=847> Military force is still necessary, but so are incentives to disarm, including the prospect of economic opportunities that are more fruitful than crime and extortion. </seg>
<seg id=848> Fortunately, building the capacity of civil society is as cheap as it is important. </seg>
<seg id=849> The Humanitarian Liaison Center serves the whole of Kirkuk at an annual cost of just $75,000 a year. </seg>
<seg id=850> With $10 million, such centers could be replicated 100 times -- with plenty of change left over. </seg>
<seg id=851> The challenge is to commit to this approach, to scale up and to support to the hilt the brave people who take on the challenge of holding power to account. </seg>
<seg id=852> Otherwise, the Iraqi people are unlikely to get the security that, after so many years of suffering, they so desperately need. </seg>
<seg id=853> Democracy on the Nile? </seg>
<seg id=854> The surprise decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment that would allow direct and competitive presidential elections may be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab World. </seg>
<seg id=855> Westerners used to pluralistic democracy may find it hard to understand what a potentially huge shift this will be in a country accustomed to military rule for over 50 years. </seg>
<seg id=856> Under the current system, Egyptian citizens can only show up on the day of a presidential referendum every six years and say yes or no to the single name that appears on the presidential ballot. </seg>
<seg id=857> This explains why someone like Mubarak always received over 90% of the vote, albeit amid indifferent turnout. </seg>
<seg id=858> Syrian and Iraqi strongmen have done even better with this system, no doubt because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters be put at the bottom of each ballot. </seg>
<seg id=859> Many people have long argued that democratization in the Middle East will not get far until Egypt becomes fully engaged in the process. </seg>
<seg id=860> Egypt could not truly set out on a path of democratization without first amending its constitution -- to downsize the Pharaonic powers of its president and set limits on his term in office. </seg>
<seg id=861> Mubarak, after all, is already in his 24th year as president. </seg>
<seg id=862> So the announcement that he wants competitive presidential elections is an important first step. </seg>
<seg id=863> The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its own advantage, but events may not be that easy to control once people begin to feel empowered. </seg>
<seg id=864> The democratic genie is out of the bottle. </seg>
<seg id=865> In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region that is now embarking on the road of democracy. </seg>
<seg id=866> Turkey at one end of the Middle East and Morocco at the other are already well on their way. </seg>
<seg id=867> The real groundswell this time seems to have come from the close timing and positive outcomes of recent elections in Iraq, Palestine, and to a lesser degree in Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id=868> The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria's occupation of Lebanon following the assassination of its former prime minister, Rafiq al-Hariri, show no signs of abating. </seg>
<seg id=869> Egyptian opposition groups, too, have staged increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in the last few weeks. </seg>
<seg id=870> The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the ailing opposition leader Ayman Nour at the end of January. </seg>
<seg id=871> The government's heavy-handed behavior reinvigorated the homegrown "Kifaya" (Enough) movement, which has demanded an end to the Mubarak regime. </seg>
<seg id=872> Suddenly the popular wisdom that Egyptians are passive and afraid to act did not seem to be holding up. </seg>
<seg id=873> An alliance of local, regional, and international forces is uniting against tyranny-as-usual on the banks of the Nile. </seg>
<seg id=874> The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime. </seg>
<seg id=875> Only a month ago, Mubarak dismissed demands for constitutional reform as "futile." </seg>
<seg id=876> But, whatever combination of events brought about his change of heart, election initiative should be welcomed. </seg>
<seg id=877> It is a necessary -- but insufficient -- first step for overhauling Egypt's stagnant political system. </seg>
<seg id=878> Egyptians are already wary of token reforms à la Tunisia, where longstanding President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali created a caricature of a constitutional amendment that appeared to open the door for competitive presidential elections, but then staged a sham contest with a few handpicked "opponents." </seg>
<seg id=879> In previous Tunisian presidential referenda, Bin Ali routinely received 99% of the vote; he now got 96%. </seg>
<seg id=880> Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform. </seg>
<seg id=881> As a measure of sincerity, he needs to order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to terminate the 24-year-long state of emergency, which effectively prevents political campaigning from taking place. </seg>
<seg id=882> Mubarak should also endorse a limit of no more than two successive five-year terms for any president. </seg>
<seg id=883> Equally necessary are confidence-building measures, including open and equal access to the media, which are now state-controlled. </seg>
<seg id=884> I have announced that I intend to contest this upcoming presidential election as a way of opening debate on these essential reforms. </seg>
<seg id=885> But I would gladly go back to my life as a private citizen once guaranteed a free and open election this fall. </seg>
<seg id=886> If seriously implemented, these steps will transform Mubarak's legacy. </seg>
<seg id=887> Along with events in Lebanon, Iraq, and Palestine, it may well usher in an Arab spring of freedom, one long overdue. </seg>
<seg id=888> Historic Election in Egypt? </seg>
<seg id=889> Egyptians go to the polls on September 7th to elect a president from among ten contenders, including the incumbent of 24 years, Hosni Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id=890> While few doubt the outcome will be his re-election, many are intensely following the process. </seg>
<seg id=891> Some 6000 domestic election monitors have been training for the event, while hundreds of foreign reporters are converging on the country this week. </seg>
<seg id=892> Although all the formal trappings of a true electoral contest are in place, important aspects of authenticity are glaringly absent. </seg>
<seg id=893> Despite promises to the contrary, this is far from a level playing field. </seg>
<seg id=894> Mubarak still commands disproportionate assets: name recognition, a virtual monopoly on state-controlled electronic media and some 85% of the print media. </seg>
<seg id=895> One week before the poll, some opposition candidates have yet to air even one campaign ad on Egyptian television. </seg>
<seg id=896> All members of the presidential election commission are Mubarak appointees, and the new election rules eliminated any independent challengers. </seg>
<seg id=897> Since the year 2000, Egypt's 8000 judges must supervise and certify election results, by ruling of the High Court. </seg>
<seg id=898> This was a major step toward fairer elections, as the judges' professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half-century of executive power grabs. </seg>
<seg id=899> So the Mubarak regime has had to use various ploys to neutralize the judge's union. </seg>
<seg id=900> One was to stretch the definition of ‘the judiciary' to include thousands of loyal government employees who have law degrees but no experience on the bench.  This boxes in the true judges, for if they protest by boycotting their supervisory duties, the task will fall once more to police from the infamous Ministry of the Interior. </seg>
<seg id=901> Thus, in the past, the judges' union tended to go along, with predictable results. </seg>
<seg id=902> In the 2000 parliamentary elections, while Mubarak's ruling party received roughly 38% of the popular vote in districts supervised by true judges, that percent somehow jumped to 86% where the quasi-judges were in charge. </seg>
<seg id=903> This year promises to be very different. </seg>
<seg id=904> In the spring the judges held a nation-wide assembly and resolved that unless the regime granted them full independence, and exclusive oversight of the voting process they would not supervise the upcoming presidential (or parliamentary) races. </seg>
<seg id=905> On September 2nd they made their final demands: allow civil society groups to observe the voting process, stop interfering in the definition of legitimate judges for purposes of the election, and agree that no ballot box will leave the presence of a legitimate judge until its contents are counted, certified and reported. </seg>
<seg id=906> Thus far, a standoff looks likely, as the head of the presidential election commission has stated publicly on Egyptian television that he refuses all citizen monitoring of the election process.   </seg>
<seg id=907> Other interesting developments on the eve of the election include a fierce public debate over whether to vote or to boycott the presidential race. </seg>
<seg id=908> Several opposition parties have called on their members to stay away in protest over restrictive election rules that strongly favor Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id=909> On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood, thought to be the single strongest opposition group in Egypt, are urging their followers to caste ballots and vote their conscience but not to give support to any ‘despotic, corrupt rulers.' </seg>
<seg id=910> This is a clear if implicit repudiation of Mubarak, the sole ruler for 24 years. </seg>
<seg id=911> Some 34 civil society organizations are preparing thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections. </seg>
<seg id=912> These groups argue that if the regime is not planning to rig the vote, then domestic as well as foreign observation of the polling process should not be a problem. </seg>
<seg id=913> The regime response is to say that any outside monitoring is an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty, and that domestic monitors are an affront to the integrity of the judges. </seg>
<seg id=914> That argument was quickly undermined when the judges' union announced their support for civil society monitors. </seg>
<seg id=915> Whether the Mubarak regime is running scared because of the mounting challenges from within and without to hold a free and fair election, or is simply incapable of ridding the party of cheating as a way of life, the present signs do not bode well for next Wednesday's polls. </seg>
<seg id=916> Meanwhile, Egyptians for the first time are experiencing the thrilling taste of defying tyranny, and enjoying some newly-found space for freedom.      </seg>
<seg id=917> Europe's Dollar Envy </seg>
<seg id=918> Currencies can become the focus not just for commercial transactions, but for diplomatic and political wrangles. </seg>
<seg id=919> When this happens, commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id=920> The politicization of money during the interwar depression was economically devastating. </seg>
<seg id=921> But there have been more recent occurrences of nasty currency wars. </seg>
<seg id=922> In the 1960's the international monetary order became the focus of a political tug-of-war. </seg>
<seg id=923> Each side had quite different theories and explanations of what was going on. </seg>
<seg id=924> The Europeans--in particular the French--complained about what General Charles de Gaulle termed the "exorbitant privilege" of the US dollar. </seg>
<seg id=925> The General and his monetary guru, Jacques Rueff, argued that the US used the dollar's status as the major reserve currency of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange-rate regime in order to run deficits and pay for its overseas military adventurism (at that time in Vietnam). </seg>
<seg id=926> France responded with calls for monetary reform that would end the peculiar role of the dollar and tried to revive the largely discredited gold standard. </seg>
<seg id=927> Europeans began a long discussion of the advantages of monetary union, achievement of which would allow them to look the dollar in the face. </seg>
<seg id=928> But from the American point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap. </seg>
<seg id=929> Other countries could change their exchange rates, and in this way could maintain greater export competitiveness. </seg>
<seg id=930> The US government was powerless in the face of an undervalued yen, fueling the belief that the rest of the world was using the dollar to attack America's manufacturing base. </seg>
<seg id=931> The Nixon administration came to the conclusion that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in monetary unilateralism--a monetary expansion so dramatic that other countries would be forced into adjusting their exchange rates. </seg>
<seg id=932> These long-forgotten battles seem suddenly very immediate once again. </seg>
<seg id=933> The world no longer has a fixed exchange-rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency--a sort of floating Bretton Woods. </seg>
<seg id=934> For Americans the reserve role of the dollar is a potential threat, while for non-Americans it is yet another instance of an American neo-imperial quest for hegemony. </seg>
<seg id=935> In this decade, China has taken the place of 1960's Japan, holding its exchange rate down in order to push export growth. </seg>
<seg id=936> Consequently it is the target of US complaints about unfair competition, and of efforts to force an exchange-rate adjustment that would deter Americans from buying Chinese toys, appliances, and clothing. </seg>
<seg id=937> Manufacturers in the US have decided that Chinese-made bras constitute a threat to the American way of life. </seg>
<seg id=938> Meanwhile, Europeans (especially the French) complain about the big US deficits, and de Gaulle's argument that the rest of the world is paying for America's wars is in fashion again. </seg>
<seg id=939> Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater part of their reserves in euros, an echo of the General's unsuccessful attempt to force America to its knees by selling dollars for gold. </seg>
<seg id=940> The 1960's ended in the breakdown of the "system," and in major financial turbulence, accompanied by an inflationary surge of commodity prices. </seg>
<seg id=941> Everyone was hurt, and America's role in world affairs was shaken. </seg>
<seg id=942> A similar collapse now is likely to have a rather different effect. </seg>
<seg id=943> The floating-rate system of today is stronger and the costs of adjustment differently distributed. </seg>
<seg id=944> Most Americans do not suffer greatly from the dollar's sharp fall, as foreign sellers have to make price adjustments for the US market. </seg>
<seg id=945> Asian economies are growing vigorously, and their central banks are building up claims on the US. </seg>
<seg id=946> They are likely to continue this policy, as the alternative would be a sudden setback to the competitiveness of their export sectors in the all-important US market. </seg>
<seg id=947> This gives the US a longer time to address a current account deficit that is in the long run unsustainable. </seg>
<seg id=948> The economically dynamic regions of the world--North America and Asia--are thus linked together in a pact that will ensure the continued centrality of the American dollar. </seg>
<seg id=949> Americans will continue to pile up debt because Asians want them to do that. </seg>
<seg id=950> To abrogate the pact would be against the interest of both parties. </seg>
<seg id=951> This is not American unilateralism, because it means working with Asia. </seg>
<seg id=952> But to Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, it looks like monetary and economic unilateralism. </seg>
<seg id=953> In the meantime, the rise of the euro against the dollar creates substantial European pain for manufacturing exporters. </seg>
<seg id=954> Europe, however, is unable to do much to gain relief. </seg>
<seg id=955> Indeed, Europe will be the major sufferer in the new currency clashes. </seg>
<seg id=956> Answers that were touted in the 1960's--revival of the gold standard, or the invention of a common European currency--do not appear to be very helpful any more. </seg>
<seg id=957> Having a single currency has turned out not to afford substantial protection. </seg>
<seg id=958> The old version of the European response--what psychologists might call "dollar envy"--will only become more acute. </seg>
<seg id=959> There will be appeals to the European Central Bank to expand the monetary base, as if imitating the dollar were the answer to all the industrial, structural, and demographic problems plaguing Europe. </seg>
<seg id=960> But a moment's reflection should remind us that Europe's problems are not amenable to currency manipulation. </seg>
<seg id=961> Protesting the new version of America's exorbitant monetary privilege should be seen for what it is: a way of compensating for a real European powerlessness. </seg>
<seg id=962> So dollar envy is here to stay, and it will become even greater as the greenback's international value melts away without any obviously bad effects on the people who print and use it. </seg>
<seg id=963> An Epidemic of Politics </seg>
<seg id=964> Americans, like citizens in countries throughout the world, have come to accept that politics plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public officials. </seg>
<seg id=965> Few of us are surprised (though some may be disappointed) when a federal judgeship is awarded or a senior diplomat appointed because the candidate passes a litmus test of loyalty to some principle that is important to the President's or Prime Minister's party. </seg>
<seg id=966> But science, almost everyone agrees, is different, and here the United States is beginning to stand as a cautionary example to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id=967> Scientific appointments should rest on objective criteria of training, ability, and performance. </seg>
<seg id=968> Clearly, it is legitimate to interrogate a future Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) about his views on abortion. </seg>
<seg id=969> But it is entirely out of place when appointees to scientific advisory committees are subjected to tests of political loyalty. </seg>
<seg id=970> Similarly, membership of bodies that conduct peer review of scientific proposals - a process that is fundamental to scientific progress - surely ought to be free of all barriers to entry that are unrelated to professional qualifications. </seg>
<seg id=971> Unfortunately, scientists in the US are running up against such barriers more and more often. </seg>
<seg id=972> During the past fall, the journal Science published several news stories related to the issue. </seg>
<seg id=973> One involved the wholesale replacement of members of the advisory committee to the National Center for Environmental Health, a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), without consulting the center's director. </seg>
<seg id=974> Similar cases involved the CDC's Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning and Prevention, the Advisory Committee on National Human Research Protections, and the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing. </seg>
<seg id=975> The current epidemic of ideology, in which advisory committees are shut down and reassembled with new members, and candidates are subjected to loyalty tests, seems old hat to some observers. </seg>
<seg id=976> Officials at the HHS call it "fairly standard practice." </seg>
<seg id=977> Well, it isn't standard practice in America - or at least it wasn't. </seg>
<seg id=978> In any case, what's really worrisome is not that the Bush administration examines candidates for compatibility with its "values." </seg>
<seg id=979> The most alarming development is how deep the ideological vetting now cuts, invading areas that once were immune to this kind of manipulation. </seg>
<seg id=980> Indeed, perhaps the most telling case in the widening political epidemic was a membership re-shuffle of the study section at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health that evaluates grants for studying workplace injuries. </seg>
<seg id=981> Advisory committees might have been vulnerable to occasional stacking of this kind in the past. </seg>
<seg id=982> After all, they recommend the policies that politicians may or may not want to consider. </seg>
<seg id=983> But study sections? </seg>
<seg id=984> In October 2002, Science published an editorial by David Michaels and a group of colleagues. </seg>
<seg id=985> Several were distinguished former public servants who had been involved with some of the committees in question, and they brought a valuable perspective to the issue, one based on their personal experience. </seg>
<seg id=986> Their piece was a story in itself, but what followed was even more interesting. </seg>
<seg id=987> It set off a volley of letters in which scientists told of similar experiences. </seg>
<seg id=988> A nominee for the National Institutes of Health's Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee told of being vetted by a White House staff member. </seg>
<seg id=989> After being asked about her views on various Bush administration policies, none of them related to the work of the committee, she was asked whether she supports the president's policy on embryonic stem cells. </seg>
<seg id=990> Another letter writer, a distinguished professor of psychiatry and psychology, reported receiving a call from the White House about his nomination to serve on the National Council on Drug Abuse. </seg>
<seg id=991> The caller declared that he must vet him to "determine whether he held any views that might be embarrassing to the president." </seg>
<seg id=992> According to the professor, a series of questions followed, with the White House official keeping a running score. </seg>
<seg id=993> One example: "You're two for three; the president opposes needle exchange [for intravenous drug users] on moral grounds, regardless of the outcome." </seg>
<seg id=994> Then the exchange took an even more chilling turn. </seg>
<seg id=995> The official asked the nominee whether he had voted for Bush, and, on being informed that he had not, asked: "Why didn't you support the president?" </seg>
<seg id=996> This is the stuff of dictatorship, not democracy. </seg>
<seg id=997> The purpose of scientific advisory committees is to provide balanced, thoughtful advice to the policy process. </seg>
<seg id=998> Nothing is gained - and much is lost - when a desired policy outcome is put first. </seg>
<seg id=999> This is why deciding which research projects to support has always been a matter for objective peer review, not politicians. </seg>
<seg id=1000> In fact, the applicable statute for all this - the Federal Advisory Committee Act - specifically requires that committees be balanced and "not inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority." </seg>
<seg id=1001> US Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and the White House Personnel Office ought to set an example to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id=1002> They can do so very easily: by following the law. </seg>
<seg id=1003> A Murder in Moscow </seg>
<seg id=1004> It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin's "dictatorship of law" has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless. </seg>
<seg id=1005> The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia's bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law. </seg>
<seg id=1006> This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1007> Germany's Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin's lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id=1008> But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia's economy. </seg>
<seg id=1009> The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense of déjà vu : just as in the KGB's heyday, people simply disappear in Putin's Russia. </seg>
<seg id=1010> Politkovskaya's is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks. </seg>
<seg id=1011> Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30. </seg>
<seg id=1012> Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia's central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14. </seg>
<seg id=1013> The fact that Russia's Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya's killing, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, doesn't inspire hope, as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy. </seg>
<seg id=1014> In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia's government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found. </seg>
<seg id=1015> Politkovskaya's murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia's President. </seg>
<seg id=1016> In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in her books "Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy" and "A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya," Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin's presidency. </seg>
<seg id=1017> As shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three fates await Putin's enemies: exile, imprisonment, or the grave. </seg>
<seg id=1018> I am not accusing Putin's government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya. </seg>
<seg id=1019> After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom. </seg>
<seg id=1020> But even if Vladimir Putin's associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out. </seg>
<seg id=1021> Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king. </seg>
<seg id=1022> Given what Politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her. </seg>
<seg id=1023> Putin's Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years. </seg>
<seg id=1024> None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin's "dictatorship of law" was anything more than a PR strategy. </seg>
<seg id=1025> The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals. </seg>
<seg id=1026> On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms. </seg>
<seg id=1027> On the other, the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia's FSB security service (the former KGB) provide no security to those murdered, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists. </seg>
<seg id=1028> These "neo-spies" include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others. </seg>
<seg id=1029> The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin's Kremlin cabal. </seg>
<seg id=1030> Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule. </seg>
<seg id=1031> The danger for the world is that Putin's lawlessness is being exported. </seg>
<seg id=1032> Across Russia's near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root. </seg>
<seg id=1033> Look at Putin's attempt to rig Ukraine's previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko. </seg>
<seg id=1034> Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin's backing. </seg>
<seg id=1035> Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies. </seg>
<seg id=1036> Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder. </seg>
<seg id=1037> It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows. </seg>
<seg id=1038> So the world must now ponder that old Latin maxim qui tacet consentere videtur -- silence means consent -- and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin's construction of a lawless energy superpower. </seg>
<seg id=1039> Russia's Pipeline to Empire </seg>
<seg id=1040> Gerhard Schroeder, who less than a month ago was Germany's Chancellor, has agreed to become chairman of the company that is building a gas pipeline from Russia, across the Baltic Sea to Germany, and on through Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1041> In many countries, Schroeder would now be charged with the crime of conflict of interest. </seg>
<seg id=1042> His apparent ethical lapse is magnified by the fact that, at this very moment, Russia is threatening to cut off Ukraine's gas supplies if that country does not give in to the pricing demands of Kremlin's state-owned gas behemoth, Gazprom. </seg>
<seg id=1043> Russia's strategic task is obvious: cutting off Ukraine's gas currently means cutting off much of Europe's gas as well, because some of its biggest gas pipelines pass through Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id=1044> By circumventing Ukraine, Poland, and of course, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally. </seg>
<seg id=1045> President Vladimir Putin and his administration of ex-KGB clones will no longer have to worry about Western Europe when deciding how hard to squeeze Russia's postcommunist neighbors. </seg>
<seg id=1046> Should Europe really be providing Putin with this new imperial weapon? </seg>
<seg id=1047> Worse, might Russia turn this weapon on an energy-addicted EU? </seg>
<seg id=1048> That a German ex-chancellor is going to lead the company that could provide Russia with a means to manipulate the EU economy is testimony to Europe's dangerous complacency in the face of Putin's neo-imperialist ambitions. </seg>
<seg id=1049> Certainly Russia's media are aware of Europe's growing dependence on Russian energy. </seg>
<seg id=1050> Indeed, they revel in it: after we integrate and increase our common gas business, Russian editorialists write, Europe will keep silent about human rights. </seg>
<seg id=1051> Putin expresses this stance in a more oblique way with his commitment to pursuing what he calls an "independent policy." </seg>
<seg id=1052> What he means by that is that Russia is to be "independent" of the moral and human rights concerns of the Western democracies. </seg>
<seg id=1053> Perhaps some European leaders really do believe that maintaining the Union's cozy prosperity justifies silencing ourselves on human rights and other issues that annoy the Kremlin. </seg>
<seg id=1054> Of course, we may speak up, briefly, about "commercial" matters like the expropriation of Yukos, but if the Kremlin puts a price on our values or criticism of Russian wrongdoing -- as in, say, bloodstained Chechnya -- Europeans seem willing to shut up rather than face the possibility of higher energy prices, or even a blockade like that now facing Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id=1055> As Putin shuffles his court, subordinating the Duma to his will, the EU's hopes for a growing "Europeanization" of Russia should be abandoned. </seg>
<seg id=1056> The Russia that Putin is building has mutated from the post-Soviet hopes of freedom into an oil and gas bulwark for his new model ex-KGB elite. </seg>
<seg id=1057> Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the chief executive of the pipeline consortium that Schroeder will chair, is a longtime Putin friend. </seg>
<seg id=1058> The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Warnig, who heads Dresdner Bank's Russian arm, was an officer in the Stasi, the East German secret police, and met Putin in the late 1980's when the Russian president was based in East Germany as a KGB spy. </seg>
<seg id=1059> That Russians tolerate a government of ex-KGB men, for whom lack of compassion and intolerance of dissent are the norm, reflects their exhaustion from the tumult of the last 20 years. </seg>
<seg id=1060> Now the Kremlin seems to think that what is good for ordinary Russians is good for independent nations as well: small and weak countries will be shown no mercy once Russia is given the tools to intimidate, isolate, and threaten them with the prospect of an energy blockade. </seg>
<seg id=1061> As a former Head of State of newly independent Lithuania, I frequently endured such threats. </seg>
<seg id=1062> The EU has signed numerous agreements with Russia including one for a "common space" for freedom and justice. </seg>
<seg id=1063> The Kremlin is very good at feigning such idealism. </seg>
<seg id=1064> Its control of Eastern Europe was always enforced on the basis of "friendship treaties," and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were "fraternal" missions. </seg>
<seg id=1065> But look how Putin abuses that "common" space: barbaric treatment of Chechens, the businessmen Mikhail Khodorkovsky imprisoned, foreign NGO's hounded, a co-leader of last year's Orange Revolution, Yuliya Tymoshenko, indicted by Russian military prosecutors on trumped-up charges. </seg>
<seg id=1066> If Europeans are serious about their common space for human rights and freedoms, they must recognize that those values are not shared by the calculating placemen of Putin's Kremlin. </seg>
<seg id=1067> The same is true of viewing Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism. </seg>
<seg id=1068> Is it really conceivable that the homeland of the "Red Terror" with countless unpunished crimes from the Soviet era, and which bears traces of blood from Lithuania to the Caucasus, will provide reliable help in stopping Iran and North Korea from threatening the world? </seg>
<seg id=1069> It seems more likely that the Kremlin's cold minds will merely exploit each crisis as an opportunity to increase their destructive power and influence. </seg>
<seg id=1070> For decades, my region of Europe was left to the mercy of evil. </seg>
<seg id=1071> So I cannot sit back in silence as Europe stumbles blindly into a new appeasement. </seg>
<seg id=1072> We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have been taught by our legacy that behind Russia's every diplomatic act lurks imperial ambition. </seg>
<seg id=1073> Western Europeans, who have been spared this legacy, should heed our warnings. </seg>
<seg id=1074> Dependence on Russia -- even if its face is now that of the allegedly "charismatic" Gerhard Schroeder -- will only lead to an abyss. </seg>
<seg id=1075> Iraq's Bullets and Ballots </seg>
<seg id=1076> When the Iraq war started in 2003, the Bush administration had very ambitious plans: as in post-1945 Germany and Japan, a long and peaceful occupation was envisaged, during which expanding oil production would assure rising prosperity as democratic structures were built piece by piece. </seg>
<seg id=1077> The foundation was to be a liberal, even post-modern constitution, complete with a guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats for women.  </seg>
<seg id=1078> In today's Iraq, there is no peace and no prosperity. </seg>
<seg id=1079> The constitution that will be voted on October 15th includes that 25% rule, but otherwise is far from liberal. </seg>
<seg id=1080> The key provision (article 2) that no law may contradict "the undisputed rules of Islam" violates the basic principle of parliamentary sovereignty, and will prevent legislation from meeting international standards. </seg>
<seg id=1081> For example, the age of sexual consent for girls cannot be set above nine, because Muhhamad himself had a nine-year-old wife. </seg>
<seg id=1082> It follows that nine-year-old girls are also adults in criminal law, and subject to capital punishment for, say, converting to another religion. </seg>
<seg id=1083> More broadly, the Shias can use this provision to place their ayatollahs over the elected parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are authorized to determine the "rules" of Islam. </seg>
<seg id=1084> Outsiders and the few Iraqi liberals worry mainly about this Islamic provision, but the widespread Sunni opposition to the constitution is aimed at other provisions: the exclusion of the "Saddamist Ba'ath Party" from political life and government, and the federalist provisions that grant autonomy to the 18 Iraqi provinces and allow them to combine into regional governments. </seg>
<seg id=1085> The exclusion rule is a personal issue for elite Sunnis -- including thousands of businessmen, professionals, even artists -- because, with few exceptions, they were all Ba'ath members. </seg>
<seg id=1086> In theory, the constitutional prohibition could be interpreted as applying only to the future. </seg>
<seg id=1087> But in practice administrative rules are now being applied to exclude so-called "high-ranking" Ba'ath members from any form of government employment, and thousands are affected. </seg>
<seg id=1088> The Sunnis would probably accept the federalist provisions if they applied only to the Kurds. </seg>
<seg id=1089> They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism, but secession by the three Kurdish-majority provinces of Dahuk, Arbil, and As Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own treasury, army (the Pesh Merga), and oil production around Kirkuk -- the second-largest reserves in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=1090> Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shias because they view them as fellow Arabs who have always accepted Sunni rule in the past, and will do so again -- unless they have their own government. </seg>
<seg id=1091> That is what the new constitution would allow, because the Shia-majority provinces in the south -- which contain the greater part of Iraq's oil reserves -- could form their own regional government. </seg>
<seg id=1092> In the usual style of the Middle East, disappointed Sunni leaders, unhappy with the constitution, now threaten violence. </seg>
<seg id=1093> But federalism is not the reason why Sunni supremacists and Islamists launch deadly attacks. </seg>
<seg id=1094> Their opposition is more elemental: they do not accept the principle of democratic majority rule. </seg>
<seg id=1095> Instead, they seek to restore Sunni minority rule. </seg>
<seg id=1096> For the Islamists, all Shias deserve death anyway, as apostates. </seg>
<seg id=1097> One Shia leader, Moqtada Sadr, also vehemently opposes federalism. </seg>
<seg id=1098> His followers are the largely illiterate, poorest, and most violent Shias of the slums of Baghdad and beyond, whose "Mahdi militia" fought American troops in 2004, even while the Americans were protecting Shias from Sunni attackers. </seg>
<seg id=1099> As a very junior priest who derives his authority from his dead Ayatollah father -- himself a populist -- Sadr is opposed by Iraq's living Ayatollahs, who despise his ignorance and violence. </seg>
<seg id=1100> Sadr cannot possibly compete with them in religious authority, so he takes an Arab-nationalist stance against them, often recalling that the highest Shia cleric, Ayatollah Sistani, is a Persian, not an Arab. </seg>
<seg id=1101> Similarly, he reminds his followers that the El Hakims, who head the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), and their "Badr" militia were subsidized exiles in Iran -- many fighting for Iran in the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war -- until the Americans "brought them back."  </seg>
<seg id=1102> Sadr opposes federalism because a Shia regional government would obey his enemies, Sistani and the SCIRI, and, he says, fall under Iranian influence. </seg>
<seg id=1103> To underline his message, Sadr sent his men to attack the Badr militia, succeeding in Baghdad, where the Mahdis are numerous, but failing in Najaf, where Sadr is hated after the destruction caused last year -- until his men were massacred by the Americans. </seg>
<seg id=1104> It was bad enough to deal with Sadr as a bandit; simple political arithmetic now dictates that he will likely be the central figure deciding the outcome of October's vote on the constitution. </seg>
<seg id=1105> To reject the constitution and force new elections for a constitutional assembly, opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces. </seg>
<seg id=1106> The Sunnis are only likely to win in two provinces, but if Sadr orders his followers in Baghdad's slums to vote "no" alongside local Sunnis, that would probably flip the capital to the constitution's opponents, ensuring its defeat. </seg>
<seg id=1107> As a political thug, Sadr is, of course, willing to be bought. </seg>
<seg id=1108> Last year he was wanted for murder. </seg>
<seg id=1109> Now he wants recognition as a statesman, money, and, at least implicitly, Sistani's and the SCIRI's humiliation. </seg>
<seg id=1110> He might receive offers, and perhaps the bargaining has already started. </seg>
<seg id=1111> But some of the Shias whom he attacks with words and bullets have thousands under arms, and think that he should be offered only bullets. </seg>
<seg id=1112> The Secret Policeman's Fall </seg>
<seg id=1113> As Hungary's Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany found out when a recorded admission that his government was lying incited riots, openness in government doesn't come easily in Eastern Europe's new democracies. </seg>
<seg id=1114> Like Hungary, post-communist Romania has struggled to increase transparency and honesty in what was once one of the world's most closed societies. </seg>
<seg id=1115> As we struggled, continued secrecy allowed an explosion of corruption and abuse of office. </seg>
<seg id=1116> But there has, at last, been real movement towards openness -- progress recognized by the European Union when it gave Romania the green light to join the European Union at the beginning of 2007. </seg>
<seg id=1117> Aside from achieving what the EU now deems a "functioning market economy," key political and legal changes, which I have overseen as Minister of Justice, range from increased transparency and control in the funding of political parties to a shakeup of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id=1118> Judicial reforms are, in turn, helping to root out corruption. </seg>
<seg id=1119> Indictments have been issued against former and current cabinet ministers, members of parliament, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police and customs officers, and other public officials, as well as directors of private companies. </seg>
<seg id=1120> In addition, new standardized forms have been introduced for declarations of assets and financial interests by anyone who holds an official position in government, parliament, public and local administration, and the judicial system. </seg>
<seg id=1121> The new declarations are the most detailed in Europe, and, more importantly, they are published. </seg>
<seg id=1122> Romania's progress is confirmed in a report released earlier this month showing that citizens' access to government information in Eastern Europe is now equal to that in established democracies. </seg>
<seg id=1123> Indeed, the report, Transparency and Silence, conducted by the Open Society Justice Initiative (available at www.justiceinitiative.org), indicates that in some ways the new democracies have something to teach the old: certain government agencies in Romania were more responsive to citizen requests for information than comparable agencies in France and Spain. </seg>
<seg id=1124> Specifically, 60% of the requests filed in Romania met, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain. </seg>
<seg id=1125> Other countries that performed well include Peru and Mexico, both of which adopted freedom of information laws in 2002, shortly after Romania. </seg>
<seg id=1126> But getting access to sensitive information in transitional democracies is not always easier, as I know from my previous work as a human rights lawyer with the Romanian Helsinki Committee. </seg>
<seg id=1127> Often we had to go to court to force disclosure of information, using Romania's 2001 Freedom of Information Act. </seg>
<seg id=1128> For example, even when we won a case regarding access to the records of wiretaps authorized by the general prosecutor, the prosecutor simply ignored the court order. </seg>
<seg id=1129> We filed a civil action against the prosecutor, and the judge imposed a fine for every day the information was withheld. </seg>
<seg id=1130> But it was only when we caught the media's attention that the data -- detailing the number of wiretaps authorized over the previous 10 years, against whom, and for how long -- were released. </seg>
<seg id=1131> With its publication, Romania began to move away from its Securitate-dominated past. </seg>
<seg id=1132> Now, inside government, I realize that sharing information with the public is sometimes hard. </seg>
<seg id=1133> But when painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative. </seg>
<seg id=1134> We could not have achieved the economic and political reforms that qualified us for EU membership if we had not subjected policymaking to public scrutiny and accepted the increased public participation in decision-making that inevitably accompanies such openness. </seg>
<seg id=1135> Indeed, this has become a sine qua non of democratic government throughout the world. </seg>
<seg id=1136> When the United States adopted its Freedom of Information Act in 1966, it joined the exclusive company of Sweden and Finland. </seg>
<seg id=1137> Today, roughly 65 countries have such laws. </seg>
<seg id=1138> In Romania, those who fought for a freedom of information law have made full use of it. </seg>
<seg id=1139> As part of the Justice Initiative study, those who request information from Romania's government were willingly supplied with the kind of information that would have been unthinkable to release just a few short years ago. </seg>
<seg id=1140> The Romanian Defense Ministry, for example, disclosed the number of armed forces personnel who died in 2003, as well as the causes of death (including 13 suicides, two shootings, and two combat deaths in Afghanistan). </seg>
<seg id=1141> Likewise, the Bucharest court was asked for the number of judges disciplined since the beginning of 2000, including grounds for any sanctions applied. </seg>
<seg id=1142> The Court transferred the request to the Superior Council of Magistrates, which provided a full response: a four-page list of all sanctioned judges, with details of the reasons and penalties. </seg>
<seg id=1143> Such information is both a product and a motor of continuing reform. </seg>
<seg id=1144> It has not always been comfortable for those in government, and there is still a tug-of-war over sensitive documents. </seg>
<seg id=1145> But, in the former communist bloc, the benefits brought by transparency have been undeniable. </seg>
<seg id=1146> At the same time, Romania's experience demonstrates that official secrecy remains a threat to the core values of democratic governance, and that only constant vigilance, in both established and young democracies, can prevent its encroachment. </seg>
<seg id=1147> Saving the Trees of Life </seg>
<seg id=1148> Nobody can get through the day without using a product that comes from a forest. </seg>
<seg id=1149> To a greater extent than most people realize, the paper we write on, the water that comes out of our taps, the medicine that heals us, the wood that builds our houses and furniture, all originate from forests. </seg>
<seg id=1150> Forests provide the fresh air we breathe and habitats for endangered species. </seg>
<seg id=1151> They also provide us with recreational opportunities, increasingly important in our complex world. </seg>
<seg id=1152> Approximately 1.5 billion of the world's rural poor directly depend on forests for basic needs like food and fuel-wood. </seg>
<seg id=1153> Yet deforestation continues. </seg>
<seg id=1154> Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares (56,000 square miles) of forests -- an area almost four times the area of Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id=1155> Irresponsible forest management, enhanced by poor governmental regulation and enforcement, and markets that reward illegal logging, are conspiring to denude the world's most valuable and threatened forests. </seg>
<seg id=1156> Once forests start to disappear, a host of environmental, social, and economic ills usually follow, affecting us all in some way. </seg>
<seg id=1157> Indonesia's Sumatra Island is a good example. </seg>
<seg id=1158> Pulp and paper companies are driving rampant and illegal destruction of forests that contain the richest diversity of plants in the world. </seg>
<seg id=1159> It is likely that plants not yet discovered will disappear along the way, as well as such endangered species as the Sumatran rhino and elephant, as well as the orangutan. </seg>
<seg id=1160> When Sumatra's forests disappear, entire communities of people will also find themselves with no proper place to live and no decent way to make a living. </seg>
<seg id=1161> Moreover, the distortion to global markets caused by trading in illegally, cheaply produced products results in disadvantages for responsible corporate citizens. </seg>
<seg id=1162> Developing countries are losing $15 billion in tax revenues annually due to illegal logging. </seg>
<seg id=1163> To make matters worse, the demand for wood for reconstruction following last year's tsunami is intensifying the already untenable demands being placed on Sumatra's forests. </seg>
<seg id=1164> Similar threats to forests are evident in the Amazon and Congo Basin. </seg>
<seg id=1165> The recent UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) shows that forests in these and other critical regions are in serious decline due to mismanagement and will continue to disappear unless serious measures are taken. </seg>
<seg id=1166> Information released by the government of Brazil indicates that deforestation of the irreplaceable forests of the Amazon, due to factors such as agricultural conversion, reached 2.6 million hectares (roughly 10,000 square miles) in the past year, bringing the total deforested area of the Amazon to 17%. </seg>
<seg id=1167> But the battle against deforestation is not lost. </seg>
<seg id=1168> Diverse organizations, environmentalists, and corporations concerned with the state of world's forests are joining forces to reverse deforestation and improve forest management. </seg>
<seg id=1169> For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the World Bank have helped Brazil's government kick-start an initiative that established over 17 million hectares (69,000 square miles) of new forest-protected areas such as national parks. </seg>
<seg id=1170> The WWF/World Bank alliance also motivated partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity. </seg>
<seg id=1171> Similarly, a summit among the leaders of the Congo Basin countries resulted in extraordinary cross-border cooperation on forest conservation and responsible management. </seg>
<seg id=1172> This in turn led to a $53 million initiative by the United States State Department to promote Congo forest conservation. </seg>
<seg id=1173> Since the leaders first met in 1999, 3.5 million hectares (more than 13,000 square miles) of new protected areas have been established in the Congo Basin. </seg>
<seg id=1174> Nevertheless, given the effects of last December's Asian tsunami, the weight of evidence provided by the MEA, and deforestation statistics from key forest regions, our efforts must continue. </seg>
<seg id=1175> The World Bank and WWF recently pledged to unite in an effort to assist in reducing the rate of global deforestation by 10% by 2010, and to work with other public and private sector institutions to pursue ambitious targets on forest conservation. </seg>
<seg id=1176> WWF studies show that if the world's forests are allotted among a mix of uses and types -- including protected areas, responsibly managed commercial forests, and restored forest landscapes -- we can provide the world's needs for forest products while conserving important environmental and social values for the foreseeable future. </seg>
<seg id=1177> Business leaders, governments, and civil society organizations must play their part in realizing this vision. </seg>
<seg id=1178> Are the Saudis Fanatics? </seg>
<seg id=1179> Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question not only the ruling House of Saud's prospects for survival, but also whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive. </seg>
<seg id=1180> Somehow, it seems, Saudi society has produced a stream of violent fanaticism that draws its inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy. </seg>
<seg id=1181> The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States were Saudis crystallized a long-held view of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance. </seg>
<seg id=1182> In some respects, this perception is accurate, but it cannot be applied to the broad Saudi public. </seg>
<seg id=1183> On the contrary, it would be a grave mistake to assume that fanatical Islamism fully defines Saudi attitudes toward religion. </seg>
<seg id=1184> Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team that undertook an extensive survey of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, and Jordan. </seg>
<seg id=1185> Our results provide a surprisingly nuanced picture of Saudi attitudes. </seg>
<seg id=1186> Compared to respondents in the other Middle Eastern countries, Saudis were less religious overall, and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriage also indicate a moderate undercurrent. </seg>
<seg id=1187> To be sure, in all four countries, religiosity is widespread, with more than 90% of respondents collectively reporting that they believe in God, in life after death, and in heaven and hell. </seg>
<seg id=1188> But the Saudis appear to be less religious than their fellow Muslims. </seg>
<seg id=1189> Sixty-two percent of Saudis described themselves as religious, compared with 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians, and 98% of Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id=1190> Americans also appear to be far more religious than Saudis, with 81% describing themselves that way. </seg>
<seg id=1191> Some of this variation may be explained by cross-national differences regarding what it means to be religious. </seg>
<seg id=1192> For example, Americans may define religiosity differently than Middle Easterners, with perhaps a weaker attachment to religious beliefs than is true in Islamic countries. </seg>
<seg id=1193> This might also account in part for the differences between Muslim countries. </seg>
<seg id=1194> But the gap in self-defined religiosity between Saudis, on the one hand, and Iranians, Jordanians, and Egyptians, on the other, is so great that it challenges the prevalent perception of Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and religious society. </seg>
<seg id=1195> Indeed, actions speak louder than words: only 28% of Saudis said that they participate in weekly religious services, compared to 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians, and 45% of Americans. </seg>
<seg id=1196> These findings, while running contrary to popular perceptions of Saudi culture, are less startling than they appear. </seg>
<seg id=1197> Sociologists of religion have long argued that in a monolithic religious environment, or when religious institutions are closely tied to the state, the overall religiosity of the public declines. </seg>
<seg id=1198> It makes sense to think that when state authorities enforce strict codes of behavior, people tend to rebel and move away from officially sanctioned religious institutions. </seg>
<seg id=1199> Little wonder, then, that Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety, are more religious than Iranians or Saudis, who must cope with local "virtue" police backed by the state. </seg>
<seg id=1200> Even on marriage, many Saudis expressed surprisingly liberal views. </seg>
<seg id=1201> Respondents were nearly evenly split on the question of arranged marriages, with half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent, while 48% preferred love as the basis of matrimony. </seg>
<seg id=1202> Given entrenched gender segregation and paternal dominance, this finding appears to reveal a strong desire for greater individual choice in what has traditionally been a family-driven decision. </seg>
<seg id=1203> Finally, the Saudis turn out to be strong supporters of democracy, once again contradicting a popular image of Saudi conservatism. </seg>
<seg id=1204> Of the Saudis polled, 58% considered democracy the best form of government, 23% disagreed, and 18% did not express an opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1205> Majority support for democracy in a country with no prior secular and nationalist history seems counter-intuitive. </seg>
<seg id=1206> In fact, support for democracy corresponds with a number of other liberal attitudes that we found in Saudi Arabia. </seg>
<seg id=1207> Supporters of democracy tend to be less religious, more secular, more tolerant of others, more critical of public-sector performance, and more concerned with Western cultural invasion. </seg>
<seg id=1208> Beyond the survey data, history has shown that liberal ideas become more popular when a despotic monarch governs people in alliance with a religious establishment. </seg>
<seg id=1209> A strong current of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid. </seg>
<seg id=1210> At the same time, an anti-clerical, secular movement on behalf of constitutionalism appeared in Iran - a reaction to the absolutist alliance between the Quajar Shahs and the religious establishment. </seg>
<seg id=1211> In view of the similarities between those historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we ought not to rule out the possibility of reform. </seg>
<seg id=1212> Now survey data, too, suggest that Saudis may well begin demanding a more transparent politics and a less interventionist religion. </seg>
<seg id=1213> The European Museum </seg>
<seg id=1214> In the late nineteenth century, Europe viewed Asia mainly as either a source of inspiration for its artists or a focus of imperial ambition. </seg>
<seg id=1215> Asians, for their part, viewed Europe as either a model of modernity, as in Meiji Japan, or a barometer of decay, as in China. </seg>
<seg id=1216> A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress. </seg>
<seg id=1217> Now, in the first years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and of Asia in Europe is changing dramatically, as Asia's economies boom while the European Union finds itself mired in a crisis of identity and confidence. </seg>
<seg id=1218> Prominent Asians, such as former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew, are now warning Europeans that if they continue on their current course, Europe will rapidly become irrelevant for anything other than tourism and high-end real estate. </seg>
<seg id=1219> A prominent Chinese businessman who divides his time between Hong-Kong and London was even more specific. </seg>
<seg id=1220> At a private gathering of top business and political leaders in Paris a few weeks ago, he said, "You Europeans are becoming a Third World country, you spend time on the wrong subjects -- the constitution, the welfare state, the pensions crisis -- and you systematically give the wrong answers to the questions you raise." </seg>
<seg id=1221> Europeans' views of Asia in general, and China in particular, are more complex and swing from lucid adjustment to a new and respected competitor to pure ideological rejection. </seg>
<seg id=1222> In May 1968, in France, the students -- or some of them, at least -- who took to the streets to invent a new world were dreaming of Maoist China, a China in the midst of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution. </seg>
<seg id=1223> Their absurd and baroque infatuation was as much the product of ignorance of Mao's crimes as it was the result of boredom in a prosperous society where unemployment was virtually nonexistent. </seg>
<seg id=1224> Today, by contrast, their heirs are openly criticizing the Asian capitalist model. </seg>
<seg id=1225> Yesterday China was an anti-capitalist lodestar for utopian revolutionaries; today it has become an ultra-liberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries -- the defenders of the status quo in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1226> The student demonstrators in the streets of Paris recently don't want to become like Chinese and Indians; they reject the logic of globalization and refuse to surrender hard-won social guarantees. </seg>
<seg id=1227> European economic elites perceive China and India very differently. </seg>
<seg id=1228> They are now fully aware that their slightly nostalgic post-colonial view of these countries as large export markets and deep reservoirs of cheap labor has become outdated. </seg>
<seg id=1229> China and India have become genuine competitors who deserve respect, if not sheer awe. </seg>
<seg id=1230> Quality, costs, and delivery times in auto manufacturing, for example, are reaching the European level. </seg>
<seg id=1231> Europe retains an advantage in terms of pure science, as in the pharmaceutical industry, but emerging world-class companies, particularly in India, are increasingly able to recruit M.I.T. and Harvard graduates, while maintaining lower labor costs and thus global competitiveness. </seg>
<seg id=1232> Unfortunately, although European leaders recognize the Asian challenge, they have failed to use it as a reality test in the irresistible process of globalization and as a call to arms in social and economic terms. </seg>
<seg id=1233> In fact, it would be fair to say that European politicians, with few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, have been slow to adjust their worldviews in accordance with the revolutionary pace of change in Asia. </seg>
<seg id=1234> Caught between their lack of long-term strategic vision and their obsession with short-term interests, Europe's political leaders have largely failed to win the respect of their Asian counterparts, in contrast to European companies, which are faring much better in Asian eyes. </seg>
<seg id=1235> Of course, on a continent that has largely failed to bury its past and close the door to nationalist ghosts, the EU is also often regarded by Asians as a model of reconciliation, peace, and prosperity. </seg>
<seg id=1236> But if Europe's performance continues to decline, would this perception survive? </seg>
<seg id=1237> Perhaps Asians would then come to regard the European model as a political version of Venice -- a place to visit with nostalgia for its past glory and admiration for its museum-like quality. </seg>
<seg id=1238> The Red and the Blue </seg>
<seg id=1239> Condoleeza Rice's replacement of Colin Powell as US Secretary of State shows that America's recent presidential election continues to produce powerful reverberations. </seg>
<seg id=1240> But understanding what that election tells us about America is important not only for Americans, but for the world. </seg>
<seg id=1241> This year's presidential vote proves that America's democracy is healthy, but that some things could be better. </seg>
<seg id=1242> Contrary to the election in 2000, when President Bush lost the popular vote and barely won the vote in the Electoral College, Bush prevailed this time by 3.5 million votes. </seg>
<seg id=1243> While some Democrats remain bitter, there is little serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush's victory. </seg>
<seg id=1244> America remains closely divided into red states (Republican) and blue states (Democrat). </seg>
<seg id=1245> If 100,000 votes changed in the red state of Ohio, John Kerry would be the president (albeit with a minority of the popular vote). </seg>
<seg id=1246> The Electoral College was included in America's constitution to protect small states in a federal system, but it now means that the political campaign focuses largely on the dozen or so battleground states where public opinion is closely divided. </seg>
<seg id=1247> More fundamentally, there is something unseemly about electing presidents without a popular majority. </seg>
<seg id=1248> So it is time for a serious debate about amending the constitution to abolish the Electoral College. </seg>
<seg id=1249> Some observers also complain about the divisive negative rhetoric and advertising that characterized the campaign. </seg>
<seg id=1250> But this should be seen in historical perspective. </seg>
<seg id=1251> In the era of the Founding Fathers, newspapers were extremely partisan, and George Washington was dismayed by the harshness of political language. </seg>
<seg id=1252> For much of its early history -- to say nothing of the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction -- the country was as closely divided as it is today, and bitter campaign rhetoric reflected the closeness of the competition. </seg>
<seg id=1253> At the same time, despite negative advertising by both sides, the three nationally televised debates raised important issues in a serious format and were widely viewed. </seg>
<seg id=1254> In general, an incumbent president with a growing economy is likely to be re-elected. </seg>
<seg id=1255> In that sense, what was surprising about Bush's re-election was how thin his majority was. </seg>
<seg id=1256> In large part, this was because of the unpopularity of the Iraq War. </seg>
<seg id=1257> Kerry tried to make the war, the low rate of job creation, inadequate healthcare, and Bush's tax cuts for upper income groups the central issues of the campaign, but some observers felt that this never added up to a clear message. </seg>
<seg id=1258> Bush countered with concerns about security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion rights. </seg>
<seg id=1259> In the end, security and cultural populism trumped economic populism. </seg>
<seg id=1260> Interpretation of the election has been influenced by exit polls in which voters were asked (after they voted) about which issues mattered most to them. </seg>
<seg id=1261> The largest number (22%) answered "moral values," comparison to 20% who cited the economy and 19% who mentioned terrorism. </seg>
<seg id=1262> Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush, and that their agenda should dominate his next term. </seg>
<seg id=1263> But a Pew poll taken a week after the election indicated that the category "moral values" encompassed a wide range of issues besides abortion rights and gay marriage. </seg>
<seg id=1264> In fact, polls show that 25% of the public support gay marriage and 35% favor legal civil unions for gay couples (the position advocated by Kerry). </seg>
<seg id=1265> Nonetheless, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage, particularly in the red center of the country, the issue helped mobilize Bush supporters to come to vote. </seg>
<seg id=1266> A larger question is whether the US is hopelessly divided. </seg>
<seg id=1267> The election map of red and blue states has given rise to Internet jokes and cartoons about the two blue coasts seceding from the red center of the country. </seg>
<seg id=1268> Some call it "Coastopia." </seg>
<seg id=1269> But the division is not that sharp. </seg>
<seg id=1270> Many states in both camps were won by narrow margins, and if one colors the map at the level of counties rather than states, much of the country looks quite purple. </seg>
<seg id=1271> Cities versus suburbs and rural areas is a better description than coasts versus heartland. </seg>
<seg id=1272> Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are clustered in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes. </seg>
<seg id=1273> But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress, tend to be more extreme than the public. </seg>
<seg id=1274> At first, this seems puzzling, because they should have an incentive to move to the vote-rich middle. </seg>
<seg id=1275> But many members of Congress represent districts that are safe for their parties, and the threat to their re-election comes in party primaries that are dominated by the more activist and extreme wings of the parties. </seg>
<seg id=1276> This tendency is reinforced by the rise of cable television, which attracts viewers by means of contentious "infotainment" programs, and Internet bloggers, who engage in fierce polemics with no editorial filter. </seg>
<seg id=1277> Reforms to alter the boundaries of Congressional districts to make them more competitive would help alleviate this problem, but few incumbent Congressmen will vote for changes that might increase their risk of defeat. </seg>
<seg id=1278> The closeness of the result suggests Bush won less of a mandate for change than he seems to believe. </seg>
<seg id=1279> Faced with difficult questions in foreign, fiscal, and social policy, he would be wise to turn toward the center rather than conciliate his conservative base, but it remains unclear whether the politics of conviction or of pragmatism will prevail. </seg>
<seg id=1280> Kicking the Oil Habit </seg>
<seg id=1281> Chancellor Angela Merkel has made addressing climate change a high priority on Germany's agenda for its EU and G-8 presidencies that begin in January. </seg>
<seg id=1282> Here is a concrete proposal, one general enough for world leaders to consider and accept, and clear enough for other governments and businesses to grasp: simply set a date, at the next G-8 summit, by which oil-powered cars would no longer be licensed in major industrialized countries. </seg>
<seg id=1283> Such a decision would have a strongly positive economic and geopolitical impact. </seg>
<seg id=1284> The real cause of today's worries over energy is not the decline in world oil reserves, but rather that domestic oil production by the top consumers -- Europe, the United States, and China -- will decline at the very moment that growing Asian demand strains the market. </seg>
<seg id=1285> Available reserves will increasingly be concentrated in the Middle East simply because supplies in all other regions will be depleted sooner. </seg>
<seg id=1286> Moreover, the main oil exporters are unwilling to subordinate their investment policies to market requirements. </seg>
<seg id=1287> Saudi Arabia seeks to run its oil production independently, while Iran scares off potential investors with bureaucratic hurdles and corruption. </seg>
<seg id=1288> Iraq suffers from a lack of security, and foreign investors in Russia are thwarted at every turn. </seg>
<seg id=1289> Those four states contain half of the world's proven oil reserves and two-thirds of what could potentially be exported. </seg>
<seg id=1290> All this, not production costs, lies at the heart of high oil prices and the scramble for oil contracts in Central Asia and Africa. </seg>
<seg id=1291> To believe that high oil prices are good because they serve the environment ignores some basic facts of international politics. </seg>
<seg id=1292> First, in many of the poorest African and Asian countries, oil imports account for a significantly higher share of national expenditure than in industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are being imperiled, while new debt crises loom. </seg>
<seg id=1293> Rents from oil production impede reforms in the major exporting countries. </seg>
<seg id=1294> Thanks to their lubricated financial strength, regimes like those in Venezuela and Iran increasingly feel unconstrained by international rules. </seg>
<seg id=1295> Latecomers among consuming nations, such as China, mimic the former habits of the industrialized West, with their long record of overlooking human rights abuses in order to secure lucrative deals with authoritarian, oil-rich regimes. </seg>
<seg id=1296> Only the world's political and economic heavyweights, the main industrialized countries that remain by far the biggest consumers of hydrocarbons, can initiate change on a global scale. </seg>
<seg id=1297> Change must begin in the transport sector, which accounts for more than half of current oil consumption -- a share that is likely to rise in the future. </seg>
<seg id=1298> The G-8 countries should therefore agree to no longer license any new, oil-powered cars from 2025 onwards. </seg>
<seg id=1299> This decision would not be directed against individual mobility, but against the dissipation of a scarce resource that is more urgently needed to produce synthetic materials. </seg>
<seg id=1300> Political leaders should not privilege any particular technology. </seg>
<seg id=1301> Instead, they should provide the automobile industry with incentives to develop alternative technologies that rely on bio-mass fuel, ethylene, hydrogen, and even natural gas during a transition period. </seg>
<seg id=1302> Countries that lead the way politically will, as a collateral benefit, provide domestic industries with a leading position in energy technology, ensuring future markets. </seg>
<seg id=1303> The expected significant reduction of CO2-emissions could eventually bring about the breakthrough that is needed in international climate policies. </seg>
<seg id=1304> But economic development comes into play as well: curing our "addiction" to oil would leave more of it to poorer, less developed, and newly industrializing countries, as well as pushing down prices and easing geopolitical energy competition. </seg>
<seg id=1305> Geopolitically, the benefits would similarly obvious, as the ability of major oil exporters to blackmail industrialized countries would be significantly reduced. </seg>
<seg id=1306> This could increase the bargaining power of the international community in the Middle East, and might strengthen those social forces in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia that seriously wish to promote political and economic reform from within. </seg>
<seg id=1307> As a technologically advanced and major automobile-producing country, Germany is well placed to bring about such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id=1308> Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics and started her political career as an environment minister -- presiding in 1995 over the first conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change -- may have more credibility in addressing the issue than any of her EU and G-8 colleagues. </seg>
<seg id=1309> Now is the time for a bold act of leadership. </seg>
<seg id=1310> The Trade-and-Aid Myth </seg>
<seg id=1311> Trade and aid have become international buzzwords. </seg>
<seg id=1312> More aid (including debt relief) and greater access to rich countries' markets for poor countries' products now appears to be at the top of the global agenda. </seg>
<seg id=1313> Indeed, the debate nowadays is not about what to do, but how much to do, and how fast. </seg>
<seg id=1314> Lost in all this are the clear lessons of the last five decades of economic development. </seg>
<seg id=1315> Foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves. </seg>
<seg id=1316> Countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts. </seg>
<seg id=1317> Aid and market access have rarely played a critical role. </seg>
<seg id=1318> Consider a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbor, which also happens to be the world's most powerful economy. </seg>
<seg id=1319> Suppose, in addition, that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border, receives a huge volume of inward investment, and is totally integrated into international production chains. </seg>
<seg id=1320> Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its rich neighbor's demonstrated willingness to act as a lender of last resort. </seg>
<seg id=1321> Globalization does not get much better than this, right? </seg>
<seg id=1322> Now consider a second country. </seg>
<seg id=1323> This one faces a trade embargo in the world's largest market, receives neither foreign aid nor any other kind of assistance from the West, is excluded from international organizations like the WTO, and is prevented from borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank. </seg>
<seg id=1324> If these external disadvantages are not debilitating enough, this economy also maintains its own high barriers on international trade (in the form of state trading, import tariffs, and quantitative restrictions).  </seg>
<seg id=1325> As the reader may have guessed, these are real countries: Mexico and Vietnam. </seg>
<seg id=1326> Mexico shares a 2,000-mile long border with the United States, which provides not only privileged market access in goods and labor, but also a claim to the resources of the US Treasury (as became apparent during the 1995 peso crisis). </seg>
<seg id=1327> By contrast, America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, established diplomatic relations only in 1995, and did not provide most-favored nation treatment to Vietnamese imports for years after that. </seg>
<seg id=1328> Vietnam still remains outside the WTO. </seg>
<seg id=1329> Now consider their economic performance. </seg>
<seg id=1330> Since NAFTA was signed in December 1992, Mexico's economy has grown at an average annual rate of barely over 1% in per capita terms. </seg>
<seg id=1331> This is not only far below the rates of Asia's economic superstars; it is also a fraction of Mexico's own growth performance during the decades that preceded the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981). </seg>
<seg id=1332> Vietnam, however, grew at an annual rate of 5.6% per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5% pace since then. </seg>
<seg id=1333> Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty, while in Mexico real wages fell. </seg>
<seg id=1334> Both countries experienced sharp increases in international trade and foreign investment, but the pictures are utterly different where it counts most: rising standards of living, particularly for the poor. </seg>
<seg id=1335> What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country's economic fortunes. </seg>
<seg id=1336> All the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home, especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso's exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy. </seg>
<seg id=1337> What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy. </seg>
<seg id=1338> With none of Mexico's advantages, Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers. </seg>
<seg id=1339> Broader post-war experience supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most. </seg>
<seg id=1340> South Korea took off in the early 1960's not when foreign aid was at its apex, but when it was being phased out. </seg>
<seg id=1341> Taiwan did not receive foreign aid or preferential market access. </seg>
<seg id=1342> China and India, today's two economic superstars, have prospered largely through sui generis reform efforts. </seg>
<seg id=1343> It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes -- Botswana and Mauritius -- to foreign demand for their exports (diamonds and garments, respectively), but that story goes only so far. </seg>
<seg id=1344> Obviously, both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets. </seg>
<seg id=1345> But, as in other cases of successful development, what distinguishes them is not the external advantages they possess, but their ability to exploit these advantages. </seg>
<seg id=1346> Witness the mess that other countries made of their natural-resource endowments. </seg>
<seg id=1347> The word "diamond" hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone. </seg>
<seg id=1348> Similarly, few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius.  </seg>
<seg id=1349> None of this absolves rich countries of their responsibility to help. </seg>
<seg id=1350> They can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators -- for example, by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign. </seg>
<seg id=1351> Similarly, increasing the number of poor-country workers allowed to work in rich countries, and providing greater scope for growth-oriented policies by relaxing WTO rules and conditionality from the US, would produce greater long-term development impact. </seg>
<seg id=1352> It is far from clear that expanding market access and boosting aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North. </seg>
<seg id=1353> Development should focus not on trade and aid, but on improving the policy environment in poor countries. </seg>
<seg id=1354> Who's Dependent Now? </seg>
<seg id=1355> If the late great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today, he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down. </seg>
<seg id=1356> His hugely influential "dependency" theory argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports, they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth. </seg>
<seg id=1357> Instead, they would become mired in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and ever-dwindling income shares. </seg>
<seg id=1358> Prebisch's preferred policy response, protectionism, proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that heeded him. </seg>
<seg id=1359> But the fact is that for many years, Prebisch seemed to have made the right call on long-term commodity price trends. </seg>
<seg id=1360> Relentless efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices for commodities, especially during the 1980's and 1990's. </seg>
<seg id=1361> With few exceptions, countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally, whereas many resource-poor Asian countries raced ahead. </seg>
<seg id=1362> Today, however, with Asia's giants, India and China, joining the global economy, prices for oil, gold, wheat, and virtually every other commodity are exploding. </seg>
<seg id=1363> While there will always be cycles -- oil prices, for example, will probably fall before they start rising again -- the long-run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come. </seg>
<seg id=1364> What many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet, though Prebisch would have realized it instantly, is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power. </seg>
<seg id=1365> Indeed, perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades. </seg>
<seg id=1366> The questions are many. </seg>
<seg id=1367> Are today's rich countries prepared for an era of co-dependency, in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial imports and technology? </seg>
<seg id=1368> Are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much wealthier? </seg>
<seg id=1369> How will the world's two superpowers, China and the United States, come to terms with the fact that important commodity-exporting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are littered with ill-formed nation states? </seg>
<seg id=1370> Some self-anointed seers portray the problem as being one of finite natural resources, with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate. </seg>
<seg id=1371> Nowadays, there are many adherents of the "Hubbert's peak" theory of oil production, which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity, the wells are running dry, and it is all downhill from here. </seg>
<seg id=1372> However, as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out, prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already. </seg>
<seg id=1373> Each time, radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate. </seg>
<seg id=1374> In the late 1800's, oil extraction involved dredging with a mule. </seg>
<seg id=1375> Today, no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor. </seg>
<seg id=1376> There have been similar improvements across the board in metals mining and agriculture. </seg>
<seg id=1377> No, the world is not about to run out of commodities. </seg>
<seg id=1378> Instead, what is happening is that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India alone) into the global economy is producing a demand shift that is likely to put far more upward pressure on commodity prices than any technology gains are likely to offset. </seg>
<seg id=1379> So, for at least the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps until humans start mining on Mars sometime in the coming centuries, prices for many natural resources are headed up. </seg>
<seg id=1380> Will the rebalancing of global economic power that results from this destabilize world politics? </seg>
<seg id=1381> World War I, of course, was partly set off by Germany's concern that the other colonial powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies. </seg>
<seg id=1382> Similarly, in World War II, Japan feared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources. </seg>
<seg id=1383> Will similar tensions arise between resource-challenged China (where even water scarcity is a problem) and the West? </seg>
<seg id=1384> Fortunately, this does not seem likely for the moment, especially given the Chinese leadership's sober and pragmatic approach to its resource problems. </seg>
<seg id=1385> The Chinese are looking to regions like Africa, hoping to find stable trading partners. </seg>
<seg id=1386> They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who don't just want to trade with commodity exporters, but to convert them as well. </seg>
<seg id=1387> Then there are those American leaders who still speak of making the US self-sufficient in energy supplies. </seg>
<seg id=1388> But this is basically a joke: self-indulgent, maybe, but self-sufficient, never. </seg>
<seg id=1389> Much of the Arab world understandably views the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of the real US strategy for securing stable energy supplies. </seg>
<seg id=1390> If they are right, one can only hope that America has a plan B. </seg>
<seg id=1391> Meanwhile, commodity prices will continue to rise, with oil exporters now constituting the largest contributors to America's gaping trade deficit. </seg>
<seg id=1392> Maybe the real US strategy is to try to owe the commodity-exporting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happy! </seg>
<seg id=1393> That is one twist that Prebisch would never have anticipated. </seg>
<seg id=1394> Iran's Hardline Choice </seg>
<seg id=1395> Iran's choice for its next president, the hardline Mayor of Teheran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is likely to worsen relations with the West and the country's international isolation. </seg>
<seg id=1396> Yet in domestic terms the Islamist regime is likely to be better off than it would have been with a more moderate result. </seg>
<seg id=1397> Clearly, Ahmadinejad has a real base of support. </seg>
<seg id=1398> But the fact that he ran as a populist, talked about helping the poor, condemned the government's performance, and acted almost like an opposition candidate are all irrelevant: he was the regime's choice, and, in the end, he received official help even against rival hardline candidates. </seg>
<seg id=1399> The regime played its hand brilliantly. </seg>
<seg id=1400> It turned the slightly more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, who disagreed with some current policies, into the "establishment" figure and its own man into the rebel. </seg>
<seg id=1401> The government thus used anti-establishment feeling to revitalize its own rule. </seg>
<seg id=1402> Given the fact that the last president, Muhammad Khatami, was a supporter of the reform movement -- albeit a timid one who ultimately accomplished nothing -- only underlines how thoroughly the rulers turned around the political situation. </seg>
<seg id=1403> Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists in the anti-Shah revolution of a quarter-century ago. </seg>
<seg id=1404> He was directly involved in the holding of American hostages in Iran, though exactly how much so remains a matter of dispute. </seg>
<seg id=1405> Most worrisome of all, he is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in Iran: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij organization. </seg>
<seg id=1406> The first is a parallel pro-regime army; the second is an organization for intimidating opponents and anyone seeking a more open society. </seg>
<seg id=1407> However, concern that an even more radical leadership has taken over in Iran is mitigated by two factors. </seg>
<seg id=1408> First, Ahmadinejad is more likely to focus on domestic issues, trying -- with whatever degree of success is unclear -- to improve living standards for the poorest Iranians. </seg>
<seg id=1409> Second, the same group that has been in control ever since the revolution will basically continue to run ideological and foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id=1410> The president has fewer powers than it seems, overshadowed particularly by Supreme Guide Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </seg>
<seg id=1411> Nevertheless, Ahmadinejad's election starkly clarifies the challenge that Iran poses for Western policy and Middle East stability. </seg>
<seg id=1412> First and foremost, it sends a signal to the most extreme elements in Iran and that country's terrorist clients -- Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and various small groups operating against Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Arab countries -- that they have a green light for launching attacks. </seg>
<seg id=1413> They are likely to assume that Iran will support them whatever they do. </seg>
<seg id=1414> Outwardly, Iran has often been relatively cautious, but, at the covert level, it has been the world's leading sponsor of terror. </seg>
<seg id=1415> Sometimes individual Iranian officials may have acted on their own to order and coordinate specific operations; they will now feel freer to do so. </seg>
<seg id=1416> Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly advocates Iran's crash program to obtain nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id=1417> Most Iranian politicians -- at least those allowed by the government to function openly -- support the program, but favor a quieter and more cautious approach. </seg>
<seg id=1418> Rafsanjani, for example, put building better economic relations with the West ahead of pushing forward on the nuclear front. </seg>
<seg id=1419> If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran, he is more likely to use the weapons in an adventurous manner. </seg>
<seg id=1420> This does not mean that he would fire them, but rather that he would use them for purposes of diplomatic blackmail, raising threats to crisis levels. </seg>
<seg id=1421> Since Iranian leaders daily proclaim their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to fight the US (Ahmadinejad stepped on a picture of an American flag on his way to vote), the risk of confrontation has increased. </seg>
<seg id=1422> Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to be bolder in subverting stability in Iraq, and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and extremists within Iraq itself. </seg>
<seg id=1423> Iran is already sending many agents into Iraq and supporting clients seeking to turn that country into a clone. </seg>
<seg id=1424> Iraqis, including Shia Muslims -- who follow the same version of Islam as Iranians — generally reject such interference. </seg>
<seg id=1425> A more militant Iranian posture is likely to increase friction with Iraq, as well as inspire more anti-American violence there. </seg>
<seg id=1426> In short, Iran's electoral outcome is a dangerous one, though precisely how destabilizing it ultimately turns out to be will depend on Ahmadinejad's actions and the degree of power granted him by Khamenei. </seg>
<seg id=1427> Moreover, dealing with such an openly extreme Iran -- radical even by the hardline regime's standards -- will be a challenge not just for the US, but for Europe as well. </seg>
<seg id=1428> Will European countries try to pretend that Ahmadinejad's militant rhetoric and provocations don't matter and that some diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear ambition can be found? </seg>
<seg id=1429> With Rafsanjani, either a real agreement or the pretense of cooperation would have been easy to maintain. </seg>
<seg id=1430> But, with Ahmadinejad, a high level of appeasement will be necessary for even the most minimal diplomatic process to continue. </seg>
<seg id=1431> Some Iranian reformers and exiles put a bright face on Ahmadinejad's election, arguing that his administration is more likely to show the regime's real face and disabuse any Western hopes of compromise. </seg>
<seg id=1432> Yet it may also represent the regime's success at co-opting dissatisfaction with a quarter-century of radical Islamist rule. </seg>
<seg id=1433> Whatever the outcome, for the West, Ahmadinejad's victory means that everything related to Iran is set to become even hotter. </seg>
<seg id=1434> Take From the Poor, Give to the Rich </seg>
<seg id=1435> President Bush seems poised to wreck America's budget for years to come. </seg>
<seg id=1436> When Bush came into office, the outlook was for budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. </seg>
<seg id=1437> Today, through a combination of irresponsible Republican-led tax cuts, a slowing economy, the bursting of the stock market bubble, and a massive increase in defense spending, huge deficits dominate the fiscal horizon. </seg>
<seg id=1438> Worse is coming, because the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress are preparing to deepen the fiscal mess. </seg>
<seg id=1439> The damage they will do will likely weaken the US and add instability to the world economy. </seg>
<seg id=1440> Traditionally, America's Republican Party stood for balanced budgets. </seg>
<seg id=1441> This changed with the Reagan Administration, when conservative Republicans favored tax cuts even at the cost of large budget deficits. </seg>
<seg id=1442> President Reagan told the American people that they could enjoy tax cuts, a military build-up, and continuation of their favorite spending programs all at the same time. </seg>
<seg id=1443> The result - no surprise - was a series of vast budget deficits that took years to clean up. </seg>
<seg id=1444> Both President George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to clean up the Reagan-era mess. </seg>
<seg id=1445> Those tax increases probably contributed to President Bush Sr's defeat by Bill Clinton in 1992. </seg>
<seg id=1446> Yet Clinton bravely decided to complete the process of restoring fiscal balance, in part to protect the long-term financing of the Social Security retirement program. </seg>
<seg id=1447> When Clinton left office in 2000, the budget situation was the best in decades. </seg>
<seg id=1448> Then along came President George Bush Jr. to replay Reagan: large tax cuts, a big increase in military spending, and continuation or even expansion of popular spending programs. </seg>
<seg id=1449> The result was predictable. </seg>
<seg id=1450> In January 2001, the cumulative budget outcome for the years 2002-2011 was projected to be $5.6 trillion dollars in surplus. </seg>
<seg id=1451> By mid-2002, those projected surpluses had vanished. </seg>
<seg id=1452> In view of these changed economic conditions, and the shadow of war in Iraq, you might expect the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress to be cautious in advocating new tax cuts. </seg>
<seg id=1453> But no, their highest priority is to enact more tax cuts that will mainly benefit the rich. </seg>
<seg id=1454> At the same time, the Administration is calling for big increases in military spending. </seg>
<seg id=1455> With the November 2004 presidential election now coming into view, you can be certain that no meaningful cuts in non-military spending programs will be made. </seg>
<seg id=1456> So massive budget deficits seem here to stay. </seg>
<seg id=1457> If domestic spending simply stays constant as a fraction of national income, the cumulative budget outcome for the next ten years will be a combined deficit of $1.5 trillion. </seg>
<seg id=1458> But this figure may be optimistic, because it probably doesn't adequately factor in the costs of a possible war in Iraq, nor another round of tax cuts, nor the risk of higher interest rates in the years ahead. </seg>
<seg id=1459> Why are Republicans so unconcerned about this mess? </seg>
<seg id=1460> Some Republican care more about tax cuts for the rich than they do about almost anything else. </seg>
<seg id=1461> Others believe that deficits will force major cuts in domestic government spending, thus shrinking the state, which is their heart's desire. </seg>
<seg id=1462> The problem with this latter view is that most taxpayers like domestic programs, and will not readily support major spending cuts. </seg>
<seg id=1463> A more intriguing question is why do Americans vote for such policies, when they should know that trouble will probably result. </seg>
<seg id=1464> One answer is that many voters do not see the looming budget troubles. </seg>
<seg id=1465> A better answer is that most Americans did not actually vote for these policies. </seg>
<seg id=1466> Voter turnout in the 2002 election was only around 40%, of which around half went to the Republicans, or around 20% of eligible voters. </seg>
<seg id=1467> Of course, the outlook need not be so bleak. </seg>
<seg id=1468> War in Iraq may be avoided. </seg>
<seg id=1469> Proposed tax cuts may be watered down or abandoned. </seg>
<seg id=1470> But I predict large budget deficits for years to come, and a growing sense of unease within the US and abroad about America's macroeconomic situation. </seg>
<seg id=1471> Foreign investors may decide to cut back financing America's budget and current account deficits on favorable terms. </seg>
<seg id=1472> The dollar may weaken, and fears of inflation may become more pronounced. </seg>
<seg id=1473> All of this will make US policymakers less confident and less flexible in their responses to economic shocks. </seg>
<seg id=1474> The poor, both inside the US and abroad, could suffer the most, as President Bush and the Congress tell the American people and the world that, due to the large budget deficits, there is no money available to address problems of poverty, disease, and education. </seg>
<seg id=1475> Unless ordinary Americans wake up to these fiscal risks, the rich may walk away with another multi-billion-dollar gift as the country and the world bear the harsh consequences for years to come. </seg>
<seg id=1476> Lessons from America's Fiscal Recklessness </seg>
<seg id=1477> George W. Bush has done more to wreck US economic policy than any other President in American history, exceeding even his mentor, Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id=1478> In just three years in office, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus that had taken a decade to construct, and that could take another decade to re-create. </seg>
<seg id=1479> In doing so, Bush has risked America's long-term economic health and social stability. </seg>
<seg id=1480> Because the long-term budgetary challenges that the US is so badly mismanaging are not unique, America's fiscal blunders provide important lessons for other countries. </seg>
<seg id=1481> The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily make themselves temporarily popular by cutting taxes and increasing public spending while running up massive public debts, leaving repayment to the future. </seg>
<seg id=1482> This trick can last a few years, but sooner rather than later budget deficits and growing public debt force a painful policy reversal. </seg>
<seg id=1483> Yet a cynical politician can buy himself re-election and perhaps be in retirement when the crisis arrives. </seg>
<seg id=1484> One would imagine that after hundreds of such episodes of fiscal irresponsibility around the world in recent decades, voters would be allergic to such tricks. </seg>
<seg id=1485> Yet Bush is doing it again, buying popularity today by doling out massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing military spending and even raising expenditure on education and health. </seg>
<seg id=1486> The result is a budget deficit equivalent to more than 5% of GDP. </seg>
<seg id=1487> What's worse is that America's long-term budgetary prospects were already troubling before Bush began his reckless policies. </seg>
<seg id=1488> The US population is aging, so there will be a sharp increase in the costs of publicly funded health care and pension systems. </seg>
<seg id=1489> Careful calculations show that future revenues under the tax policies favored by Bush are likely to fall tens of trillions of dollars short of the costs of public pensions, health care, and other fiscal spending expected by the public. </seg>
<seg id=1490> At some point in the future, there will thus need to be steep increases in tax collections, sharp cuts in public spending, or both, to correct Bush's actions. </seg>
<seg id=1491> So why does the public support his policies? </seg>
<seg id=1492> Because the public has little understanding or concern about these long-term consequences, even though they will eventually hurt most Americans. </seg>
<seg id=1493> The richest taxpayers are, of course, happy because they received the bulk of the tax cuts. </seg>
<seg id=1494> Amazingly, the richest 5% of US taxpayers received almost half of the tax cuts, and these rich taxpayers clearly expect the other 95%--the middle class and the poor--to bear most of the future spending cuts and tax increases. </seg>
<seg id=1495> Meanwhile, Bush has convinced many poor and middle-class voters that they should be happy, too, without telling them that they will have to pay for their small tax cuts with much larger cuts in future government services if his administration's policies prevail in the long term. </seg>
<seg id=1496> If Americans had a political memory, they would understand that they already rode this fiscal "roller coaster" once in the past 20 years. </seg>
<seg id=1497> Ronald Reagan also came to office promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending. </seg>
<seg id=1498> The result was a huge budget deficit by the middle of the 1980's. </seg>
<seg id=1499> Tax cuts made Reagan enormously popular and helped win him re-election in 1984. </seg>
<seg id=1500> It then took over a decade--starting in Reagan's second term, and continuing through the terms of George Bush, Sr. and Bill Clinton--to get the budget back to surplus. </seg>
<seg id=1501> Of course, this meant approving fresh tax increases, which cost George Bush, Sr. his re-election and led to the polarized politics of the 1990's. </seg>
<seg id=1502> History will almost certainly repeat. </seg>
<seg id=1503> Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believe that today's budget deficits will eventually force government social spending to be cut sharply. </seg>
<seg id=1504> They hope to dismantle programs such as Social Security and Medicare. </seg>
<seg id=1505> But the US public strongly supports these social programs. </seg>
<seg id=1506> So the right-wing strategy of cutting taxes first in order to force cuts in social programs later will fail, and eventually tax rates will have to rise. </seg>
<seg id=1507> Others in the Bush administration argue that tax cuts are important for pulling the US out of recession. </seg>
<seg id=1508> This argument is also mistaken. </seg>
<seg id=1509> America's economy could have recovered without the tax cuts, and perhaps even more robustly. </seg>
<seg id=1510> In any event, it is a huge mistake to base long-term tax policies on the short-run business cycle. </seg>
<seg id=1511> There are two vital lessons for other countries. </seg>
<seg id=1512> The first is that the looming US budget deficits will sooner or later limit America's international power. </seg>
<seg id=1513> Americans supported the Iraq war only because they didn't have to pay for it with increased taxes. </seg>
<seg id=1514> When Americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less likely to support expensive military operations abroad. </seg>
<seg id=1515> Indeed, the US will be deeply divided internally as the public grapples with the fiscal mess left by Bush. </seg>
<seg id=1516> The second lesson is that countries ought to plan their budgets taking into account the rising fiscal costs of an aging population. </seg>
<seg id=1517> Long-term budgetary conditions are rarely in clear view of taxpayers or the parliament. </seg>
<seg id=1518> Governments should be required to submit long-term budget assessments together with their annual budget proposals, in order to reduce the tendency towards short-run political manipulation of the budget. </seg>
<seg id=1519> The US can serve as an early warning to other countries. </seg>
<seg id=1520> The White House ought to provide others with the same caveat that magicians on television give their viewers: "Do not try this at home." </seg>
<seg id=1521> The Political Stock Market </seg>
<seg id=1522> Many economic and financial analysts complain that emerging countries' stock markets are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic. </seg>
<seg id=1523> The unstated assumption seems to be that, in contrast, some pristine force of economic nature drives stock markets in advanced countries, and that forecasting their performance is thus like forecasting the growth of trees. </seg>
<seg id=1524> This description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just biased, because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries. </seg>
<seg id=1525> Indeed, the best analysts know that forecasting the performance of any country's stock market substantially means forecasting how well the government wants stock market investors to fare in the current political environment. </seg>
<seg id=1526> Consider the United States stock market, by far the world's largest. </seg>
<seg id=1527> The general perception is that the government leaves companies alone and that the returns from investing in the US stock market reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy. </seg>
<seg id=1528> This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfolio investors from around the world. </seg>
<seg id=1529> But the returns that make US stock markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance. </seg>
<seg id=1530> In particular, tax rates that affect stocks have varied through time as political pressures change. </seg>
<seg id=1531> During World War II, for example, political support for great fortunes diminished and the government sharply increased taxes on capital gains, dividends, and high incomes in general. </seg>
<seg id=1532> When World War II produced a strong recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930's, President Roosevelt and Congress slapped on an excess-profits tax to ensure that shareholders would not benefit too much. </seg>
<seg id=1533> By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but the stock market was low, US voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man many thought too right wing to be president. </seg>
<seg id=1534> He asked for - and got - cuts in capital gains, dividend, and income taxes. </seg>
<seg id=1535> Political interference in the stock market is not merely about taxes on capital gains, dividends, and income. </seg>
<seg id=1536> Property taxes, excise taxes, import duties, and sales taxes - all of which are paid, directly or indirectly, by corporations - can have a magnified impact on corporate profits, and hence on the stock market. </seg>
<seg id=1537> It is no coincidence that wherever stock markets thrive, governments take care that these taxes stop well short of destroying after-tax corporate profits. </seg>
<seg id=1538> Indeed, the politics of stock markets does not stop with taxes. </seg>
<seg id=1539> On the contrary, almost every activity of government has an impact on corporate profits, and in turn, on the stock market. </seg>
<seg id=1540> After the 1929 stock market crash the US government suspended much anti-trust activity, allowing companies to acquire monopoly power that would boost their value. </seg>
<seg id=1541> This policy delayed the recovery from high unemployment, but even that was not enough to rein in the political forces arrayed in favor of supporting the stock market. </seg>
<seg id=1542> Similarly, one of the most important things that President Reagan did was to destroy much of the remaining power of America's labor unions, which compete for their share of the corporate pie. </seg>
<seg id=1543> Reagan's defeat of the Air Traffic Controllers' strike in 1981 was a watershed event for the US labor movement - and for the stock market, which started its dramatic bull market in 1982. </seg>
<seg id=1544> The US government has been particularly aggressive in supporting the stock market since the peak of the equities price bubble in 2000, most notably cutting interest rates repeatedly. </seg>
<seg id=1545> Of course, this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not supporting the stock market. </seg>
<seg id=1546> But it is a telling sign of the US stock market's significance that one of the most important factors perceived to be weighing on the economy was declining equity prices. </seg>
<seg id=1547> Indeed, the authorities' response was not limited to monetary stimulus. </seg>
<seg id=1548> The US National Income and Product Accounts show that the effective rate of corporate profits tax (the percentage of profits actually paid to the government in taxes) crested at 33.7% in the first quarter of 2000 - the peak of the stock market and the economy in general - and fell to 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was down. </seg>
<seg id=1549> Much of that decline reflects explicit tax relief measures voted by Congress, as well as the perception among corporations that in the current economic and political environment they can be more aggressive in tax avoidance. </seg>
<seg id=1550> Moreover, after the stock market crash, the maximum tax on dividends paid on stocks was slashed from 35% to 15%, giving a substantial new advantage to long-term investors and boosting the compounding effect of reinvesting after-tax dividends. </seg>
<seg id=1551> Again, this tax cut was justified in terms of stimulating the economy, which can, of course, be said of practically any measure aimed at supporting the stock market. </seg>
<seg id=1552> But it is the balance of political forces that determines whether such a justification will be credible. </seg>
<seg id=1553> One might say that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and a weak labor movement, have operated in the US for the past 200 years - and can thus be expected to continue operating in the future, producing high stock market returns and attracting huge inflows of foreign investment. </seg>
<seg id=1554> Those who believe that investments in the US stock market will maintain the same strong growth trend for decades may well be right. </seg>
<seg id=1555> But one should be clear about what one is forecasting. </seg>
<seg id=1556> Essentially, one is forecasting not just economics, but politics - and even the cultural values - that shape economic policies and performance. </seg>
<seg id=1557> The Global Home </seg>
<seg id=1558> Homes are the most local of investments, rooted to a particular place like a tree, and thus thriving or withering in response to local economic conditions. </seg>
<seg id=1559> The whole world flashes by on our television screens, but the market for our homes, which is comprised almost entirely of local amateurs, remains grounded right there in our own backyard. </seg>
<seg id=1560> Soon, however, this could all change. </seg>
<seg id=1561> Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in collaboration with my company, MacroMarkets, as well as Fiserv and Standard & Poor's, will launch futures and options contracts on home prices in ten cities in the United States. </seg>
<seg id=1562> The contracts will be settled on the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, which developed out of academic work that my colleague Karl Case and I pioneered almost twenty years ago. </seg>
<seg id=1563> For many years we have been campaigning for housing futures, but no exchange wanted to use such indices to create a futures market until now. </seg>
<seg id=1564> The futures markets on home prices will allow investors around the world to invest in US homes indirectly, by buying interests in them through these markets. </seg>
<seg id=1565> An investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro, or Tokyo will be able to invest in owner-occupied homes in New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas. </seg>
<seg id=1566> A fundamental principle of financial theory -- "diversification" or "risk spreading" -- implies that interest in the new contracts will be high. </seg>
<seg id=1567> People and businesses in New York, for example, are overexposed to their local real estate risks, so they should reduce this risk by selling New York home price futures. </seg>
<seg id=1568> People in Tokyo will assume some of this risk by purchasing New York home price futures if the price is right. </seg>
<seg id=1569> The New Yorkers still live in their own homes, but now they have spread their investment risk worldwide. </seg>
<seg id=1570> A genuine futures market on single-family homes has not been attempted since 1991 when the London Futures and Options Exchange (now merged into Euronext.liffe) failed in its effort to launch such a market in Britain. </seg>
<seg id=1571> That attempt never generated much trading volume. </seg>
<seg id=1572> The Exchange threw a party and no one came. </seg>
<seg id=1573> British spread-betting markets for home prices, and some retail online markets, have never amounted to much either. </seg>
<seg id=1574> Will it be different this time? </seg>
<seg id=1575> To be sure, starting a new market is always an uncertain proposition: people want to go to parties only if a lot of other people are there; if no one is there, no one wants to come. </seg>
<seg id=1576> Likewise, in markets without many investors, not enough trades can be executed to generate the returns needed to attract them. </seg>
<seg id=1577> As is often true of great parties, it can be a bit of a mystery how substantial new markets get started, but we know that it does happen from time to time. </seg>
<seg id=1578> Initial indications suggest growing interest in futures trading for home prices, particularly as so much talk about the "housing bubble" underscores the importance of diversifying risk. </seg>
<seg id=1579> After the CME's announcement, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said that it plans to create futures and options contracts on major US regions, to be based on the median home price published by the National Association of Realtors. </seg>
<seg id=1580> But, aside from strong public interest in investing in housing and in hedging housing risks, another critical issue must be resolved if futures markets are to succeed: prices must be revealed, and investors must understand what these prices mean. </seg>
<seg id=1581> I believe there is a very good chance that many of these futures markets will soon be predicting substantial price declines in some US cities over the next year. </seg>
<seg id=1582> They will be in what traders call "backwardation": the future price in the market today is lower than the price of a home today. </seg>
<seg id=1583> Maybe backwardation won't appear on the first day that housing futures are traded, but there is a good chance it will come within a matter of months. </seg>
<seg id=1584> We may need backwardation in some of these markets if they are to fulfill their function. </seg>
<seg id=1585> Everyone knows that there has been a huge real estate boom in many of these cities (and elsewhere in the world) in recent years. </seg>
<seg id=1586> International investors are not likely to want to invest in these cities unless expectations of a price decline are built into the futures markets, as people in Tokyo understand from their own bitter experience. </seg>
<seg id=1587> But if backwardation is strong enough, even investors who think that the US housing market is headed for a fall will still be able to expect a good return from home price futures, because they are already getting a discounted price in the futures market. </seg>
<seg id=1588> Nevertheless, it will require some adjustment for New Yorkers seeking to hedge their own real estate investments to sell futures contracts that have a built-in price decline. </seg>
<seg id=1589> They will have to get used to the idea that the market already expects the decline, and that they can protect themselves only for that margin of possible future price declines that exceed this expectation. </seg>
<seg id=1590> In fact, such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur when we actually see the futures market prices. </seg>
<seg id=1591> Until now, the future course of real estate prices has been merely a matter of diverse opinion. </seg>
<seg id=1592> When markets create an international consensus on the future price of homes in cities around the world, we will be better able to manage the risks facing these cities, thereby stabilizing their economies -- and our own lives. </seg>
<seg id=1593> What News Is Moving the Markets? </seg>
<seg id=1594> Stock markets in much of the world have shown sharp cumulative declines since around May 10, with most of the drop occurring in the two-week period to around May 23, but with prices continuing to fall on average since then. </seg>
<seg id=1595> Does trouble in the world's stock markets mean trouble for the world economy? </seg>
<seg id=1596> Let us look at the biggest declines. </seg>
<seg id=1597> Of the major countries' indexes, the biggest crash was in India, where stock prices fell 16.9% from May 10 to May 22. </seg>
<seg id=1598> The debacle on the other side of the globe was almost as big and the peaks and troughs were within a day or two of those in India: in Argentina, stock prices fell 16.1%, in Brazil, they fell 14.7%, and in Mexico, they fell 13.8%. </seg>
<seg id=1599> European markets also suffered large losses. </seg>
<seg id=1600> In Sweden, stock prices fell 15.2% between May 9 and May 22; over nearly the same period, prices fell 9.7% in Germany , 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom, and 9.3% in Italy. </seg>
<seg id=1601> Likewise, in Asia, stock prices fell 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong, and 8% in Japan from their respective peaks to troughs over very nearly the same time period. </seg>
<seg id=1602> Many commentators try to tie such events to developments the United States. </seg>
<seg id=1603> But US stock prices fell only 5.2% between May 9 and May 24. </seg>
<seg id=1604> Nor does China appear to be behind the global decline, since stock prices there actually rose during this period. </seg>
<seg id=1605> Economists' standard explanation revolves around monetary policy. </seg>
<seg id=1606> In the wake of the great deflation scare of 2003, central banks around the world cut interest rates, setting off speculative booms in both stock and housing markets. </seg>
<seg id=1607> But now, according to this view, rising interest rates are beginning to bite, which portends further declines in asset prices. </seg>
<seg id=1608> There is certainly an important element of truth in this argument. </seg>
<seg id=1609> The US Federal Reserve did indeed raise rates on May 10, and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, indicated then that there may be further rate increases in the future. </seg>
<seg id=1610> Worsening US inflation data were reported on May 17, suggesting that further monetary tightening is in store. </seg>
<seg id=1611> Economists like to view the world as logical and manageable, which implies that they understand what is happening. </seg>
<seg id=1612> But, in doing so, they often exaggerate central banks' role. </seg>
<seg id=1613> Indeed, the US rate increase was just one in a series of rate hikes -- the 16th in a row. </seg>
<seg id=1614> No other major central bank raised rates after the stock market drops began in May until June 7- 8, when several did (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey) </seg>
<seg id=1615> Another factor is the price of oil, which rose 24% from March 22 to May 2, setting all-time records along the way. </seg>
<seg id=1616> Surely, this was a major event that would plausibly affect stock markets all over the world. </seg>
<seg id=1617> Oil price increases have been a culprit in virtually every economic recession since World War II. </seg>
<seg id=1618> Still, the oil price increases do not correspond to the time interval in mid-May when stock market indexes fell most sharply. </seg>
<seg id=1619> To argue that oil price increases caused the stock market declines presupposes a time lag of several weeks. </seg>
<seg id=1620> But stock markets are not very logical, and there could be a lagged response to the oil price shocks. </seg>
<seg id=1621> As with any other prices in financial markets, an increase attracts attention. </seg>
<seg id=1622> When oil prices rise quickly, people watch the news related to oil prices and talk to each other more about oil prices, hence creating heightened sensitivity to this news. </seg>
<seg id=1623> The crisis in the Middle East is tied to oil prices, and it dominated the news in May. </seg>
<seg id=1624> Ominous signs and strong language used by various political figures were possibly amplified in investors' minds by the oil price increases. </seg>
<seg id=1625> On May 8, Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres, reacting to hostile statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that "the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map." </seg>
<seg id=1626> Similarly, near the beginning of the May stock market tumble, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the world's most populous country with a Muslim majority, and newspapers reported on May 13 that he had received a standing ovation from students at two of the country's top universities. </seg>
<seg id=1627> This story might have been interpreted as evidence that Ahmadinejad's brinkmanship on the nuclear issue was paying off for him politically, fueling a perception that the tense situation in the Middle East might lead to even higher oil prices. </seg>
<seg id=1628> These news stories may seem far more remote from the stock market than is monetary policy. </seg>
<seg id=1629> But public reaction to them, together with recent oil price increases, may well account in good measure for the change in market psychology. </seg>
<seg id=1630> Attitudes toward risks change over time, and events like Ahmadinejad's and Peres's remarks can precipitate such changes. </seg>
<seg id=1631> So, while these things happen in ways that are hard to quantify, maybe analysts should pay attention to the words of Ahmadinejad just as carefully as they do to those of Bernanke in trying to understand the direction of the world's stock markets. </seg>
<seg id=1632> Economists might not like to focus on the public mindset and how it interacts with price changes, world news stories, and speculative dynamics. </seg>
<seg id=1633> After all, doing so implies that economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscient) than they like to imagine. </seg>
<seg id=1634> But such a focus makes intuitive sense. </seg>
<seg id=1635> What is really on investors' minds? </seg>
<seg id=1636> Ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure; Bernanke is not. </seg>
<seg id=1637> Ahmadinejad is embarking on an adventure; Bernanke is not. </seg>
<seg id=1638> And, perhaps most importantly, Ahmadinejad is a destabilizing influence; Bernanke is not. </seg>
<seg id=1639> Indeed, whatever their ultimate cause, the mid-May drops in stock prices throughout the world are indicative of unstable market psychology. </seg>
<seg id=1640> It is difficult to believe that they were related only to opinions about likely monetary policy, and not to larger and deeper issues, including such things as energy and political tension, that underpin the performance of the world economy.

<seg id=1641> Why Pay More for Fairness? </seg>
<seg id=1642> Marks & Spencer, a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain, recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea, totaling 38 lines, to Fairtrade, a marketing symbol of "ethical production." </seg>
<seg id=1643> The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops. </seg>
<seg id=1644> It is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton. </seg>
<seg id=1645> The announcement came during "Fairtrade Fortnight," a two-week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries, telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities. </seg>
<seg id=1646> The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, locally produced foods, and eggs from hens not kept in cages. </seg>
<seg id=1647> In the UK, a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers. </seg>
<seg id=1648> There is no comparable US research, but related data, and discussions with my own students, suggests that the figure would be much lower. </seg>
<seg id=1649> Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage. </seg>
<seg id=1650> For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1.26 per pound, no matter how low the market price may fall. </seg>
<seg id=1651> If the market price rises above that figure, the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher. </seg>
<seg id=1652> Small farmers, for their part, are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation. </seg>
<seg id=1653> Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages, comply with health, safety, and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of workers' associations, provide good housing if workers are not living at home, and do not use child labor or forced labor. </seg>
<seg id=1654> Not every one approves of Fairtrade. </seg>
<seg id=1655> Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a "well-meaning dead end." </seg>
<seg id=1656> With some justification, he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals, but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply. </seg>
<seg id=1657> In Lindsey's view, if we want to assist coffee growers, we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops -- and here he rightly points to rich nations' trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled -- or to move into higher-value products, like specialty coffees, that bring higher prices. </seg>
<seg id=1658> What is curious about Lindsey's argument, however, is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends -- encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price. </seg>
<seg id=1659> Pro-market economists don't object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products. </seg>
<seg id=1660> If people want to pay $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that's what James Bond prefers, economists don't object that the market is being distorted. </seg>
<seg id=1661> So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children? </seg>
<seg id=1662> Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children. </seg>
<seg id=1663> That's a possible strategy, but there are advantages to Fairtrade. </seg>
<seg id=1664> The growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like, both for its taste and for the way it is grown. </seg>
<seg id=1665> If their product sells well, they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world. </seg>
<seg id=1666> From the growers' perspective, receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce. </seg>
<seg id=1667> Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more "anti-market" than paying more for a Gucci label, and it reflects better ethical priorities. </seg>
<seg id=1668> Fairtrade is not a government subsidy. </seg>
<seg id=1669> Its success depends on market demand, not political lobbying. </seg>
<seg id=1670> Fortunately, in Europe, that market demand is growing rapidly. </seg>
<seg id=1671> One hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world, and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending. </seg>
<seg id=1672> Pigs, Calves, and American Democracy </seg>
<seg id=1673> Amidst all the headlines about the Democrats gaining control of the United States Congress in the November elections, one big election result was largely ignored. </seg>
<seg id=1674> Although it illuminated the flaws of America's political system, it also restored my belief in the compassion of ordinary Americans. </seg>
<seg id=1675> In Arizona, citizens can, by gathering a sufficient number of signatures, put a proposed law to a direct popular vote. </seg>
<seg id=1676> This year, one of the issues on the ballot was an act to prohibit tethering or confining a pregnant pig, or a calf raised for veal, in a manner that prevents the animal from turning around freely, lying down, and fully extending his or her limbs. </seg>
<seg id=1677> Those who know little about modern factory farming may wonder why such legislation would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id=1678> Under farming methods that were universal 50 years ago, and that are still common in some countries today, all animals have the space to turn around and stretch their limbs. </seg>
<seg id=1679> Today, however, about 90% of US breeding sows -- the mothers of the pigs that are raised and killed for pork, bacon, and ham -- spend most of their lives locked in cages that measure about two feet by seven feet (0.6 meters by 2.2 meters). </seg>
<seg id=1680> They are unable to turn around, lie down with their legs fully extended, or move more than a step forward or backward. </seg>
<seg id=1681> Other sows are kept on short tethers that also prevent them turning around. </seg>
<seg id=1682> Veal calves are similarly confined for all their lives in individual stalls that do not permit them to turn around, lie down, or stretch their limbs. </seg>
<seg id=1683> These methods are, essentially, labor-saving devices -- they make management of the animals easier and enable units with thousands or tens of thousands of animals to employ fewer and less skilled workers. </seg>
<seg id=1684> They also prevent the animals from wasting energy by moving around or fighting with each other. </seg>
<seg id=1685> Several years ago, following protests from animal welfare organizations, the European Union commissioned a report from its Scientific Veterinary Committee on these methods. </seg>
<seg id=1686> The committee found that animals suffer from being unable to move freely and from the total lack of anything to do all day. </seg>
<seg id=1687> Common sense would, of course, have reached the same conclusion. </seg>
<seg id=1688> Following the report, the EU set dates by which close confinement of these animals would be prohibited. </seg>
<seg id=1689> For veal calves, that date, January 1, 2007, is almost here. </seg>
<seg id=1690> Individual stalls for sows, already outlawed in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned across the entire EU from 2013. </seg>
<seg id=1691> Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens, which are typically kept crammed into bare wire cages with no room to stretch their wings, are also being phased in. </seg>
<seg id=1692> In the US, no such national measures are anywhere in sight. </seg>
<seg id=1693> In the past, when my European friends have asked me why the US lags so far behind Europe in matters of animal welfare, I have had no answer. </seg>
<seg id=1694> When they pressed me, I had to admit that the explanation could be that Americans care less about animals than Europeans. </seg>
<seg id=1695> Then, in 2002, animal welfare advocates put a proposal to ban sow stalls on the ballot in Florida. </seg>
<seg id=1696> To the surprise of many, it gained the approval of 55% of those voting. </seg>
<seg id=1697> Last month in Arizona, despite well-funded opposition from agribusiness, the ban on small cages for sows and veal calves also passed, with 62% support. </seg>
<seg id=1698> Neither Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive states -- both voted for George W. Bush over John Kerry in 2004. </seg>
<seg id=1699> So the results strongly suggest that if all Americans were given a chance to vote on keeping pregnant pigs and calves in such tight confinement, the majority would vote no. </seg>
<seg id=1700> Americans seem to care just as much about animal welfare as Europeans do. </seg>
<seg id=1701> So, to explain the gap between Europe and the US on farm animal welfare, we should look to the political system. </seg>
<seg id=1702> In Europe, the concerns of voters about animal welfare have been effective in influencing members of national parliaments, as well as members of the European Parliament, resulting in national legislation and EU directives that respond to those concerns. </seg>
<seg id=1703> In the US, by contrast, similar concerns have had no discernible effect on members of Congress. </seg>
<seg id=1704> There is no federal legislation at all on the welfare of farm animals -- and very little state legislation, either. </seg>
<seg id=1705> That, I believe, is because agribusiness is able to put tens of millions of dollars into the pockets of congressional representatives seeking re-election. </seg>
<seg id=1706> The animal welfare movement, despite its broad public support, has been unable to compete in the arena of political lobbying and campaign donations. </seg>
<seg id=1707> In US electoral politics, money counts for more than the opinions of voters. </seg>
<seg id=1708> Party discipline is weak, and Congressmen must themselves raise most of the money that they need for re-election -- and that happens every two years for members of the House of Representatives. </seg>
<seg id=1709> In Europe, where party discipline is strong and the parties, not the individual candidates, finance election campaigns, money plays a smaller role. </seg>
<seg id=1710> In the US, a nation that prides itself on its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are hardly the only losers. </seg>
<seg id=1711> What's New About the New All-Afghan Army? </seg>
<seg id=1712> The murder of Afghanistan's Minister of Aviation by a mob (perhaps incited by members of Afghanistan's own interim administration) shows that Afghan society remains deeply fissured. </seg>
<seg id=1713> The first reforms to Afghanistan's army will only make these divisions worse. </seg>
<seg id=1714> The Minister of Defense in Hamid Karzai's temporary administration in Kabul has already named the top officers of this new army. </seg>
<seg id=1715> The Minister, General Mohammed Fahim, is a Tajik from the Panjshir district in the North, who rose three months ago to command the Northern Alliance forces that captured Kabul after American bombers cleared the way for them. </seg>
<seg id=1716> As a group, his appointments pose a direct challenge to Mr. Karzai's goal of reunifying the country. </seg>
<seg id=1717> Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation, the largest group being Pashtuns, with two-fifths of the total. </seg>
<seg id=1718> Hazaras and Tajiks constitute about a fifth each of the population. </seg>
<seg id=1719> Of thirty-eight officers elevated to general's rank by Mr. Fahim, thirty-seven are Tajiks, the other being Uzbek. </seg>
<seg id=1720> If any of the country's fifteen to seventeen million Pashtuns are recruited as soldiers, they will serve under a command structure made up almost entirely of Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id=1721> The Pashtuns' language, however, is as different from Tajik as Spanish is from English and millions of Pashtuns of military age know only a smattering of Tajik, at best. </seg>
<seg id=1722> The geographical profile of the new military leadership is as narrow as its ethnic makeup. </seg>
<seg id=1723> Thirty-five of the thirty-eight senior officers hail from one small area north of Kabul consisting of Parwan province (where the Bagram airport is located) and the nearby Panjshir valley, long the Northern Alliance's stronghold. </seg>
<seg id=1724> Stated differently, potential leaders from twenty-seven of Afghanistan's twenty-nine provinces were excluded from their country's new military elite. </seg>
<seg id=1725> Perhaps so narrow-based a group could overcome the impression that its members are a closed clique if they represented a broad cross-section of the country's dozen or more political parties. </seg>
<seg id=1726> But this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id=1727> Eighteen of the thirty-eight top brass come from one party, the Jamiat-e-Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by mullah and former theology professor Burhanuddin Rabbani. </seg>
<seg id=1728> It was this party that ruled Kabul briefly in the mid-1990s, creating the bloodshed and chaos that caused most Afghans to welcome the coming of the Taliban. </seg>
<seg id=1729> Almost equaling the number of Jamiat members in the army hierarchy are Communists. </seg>
<seg id=1730> Sixteen of the thirty-eight have long been aligned with this party, whose ploys in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which cost two-and-a-half million Afghan lives. </seg>
<seg id=1731> Most Afghans today view the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that Czechs or Poles reserve for Hitler's National Socialists. </seg>
<seg id=1732> True, people in Afghanistan, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons, and by no means were all of them hard-core ideologues. </seg>
<seg id=1733> But in the case of General Fahim's generals, six were professional Communist Party workers, and continued to serve the Party after the Red Army's invasion. </seg>
<seg id=1734> All six of these men, plus three more Communists who served as officers in the Afghan army, collaborated actively during the Soviet's decade-long occupation of Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id=1735> Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of France's post-World War II officer corps had sided with the Wehrmacht during its occupation of their country. </seg>
<seg id=1736> In Afghanistan news travels quickly by word of mouth. </seg>
<seg id=1737> Afghan nationalists (which includes nearly all Afghans) will soon discover the political backgrounds of members of General Fahim's inner circle, if they don't know already. </seg>
<seg id=1738> Even this overwhelming evidence of one-sidedness and bias in the formation of the new army's high command could be neutralized if the generals brought professionalism and commitment to the patriotic values of a truly national armed forces to their work. </seg>
<seg id=1739> Unfortunately, only ten of the thirty-eight brass promoted by Fahim have backgrounds as professional military officers. </seg>
<seg id=1740> An eleventh served as a pilot. </seg>
<seg id=1741> By contrast, twenty-four of the total (the backgrounds of the remaining four are unknown) come from civilian life, whether the professions, Communist Party offices, or in one case, a career as a mullah. </seg>
<seg id=1742> What do all these statistics mean in terms of day-to-day reality? </seg>
<seg id=1743> They mean that when the commanders of the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as American military and diplomatic officials, meet Afghanistan's Deputy Minister of Defense they will encounter Abdul Rashid Dostum, a notoriously brutal and corrupt warlord and Communist who keeps in touch with old Red Army friends still serving in Moscow. </seg>
<seg id=1744> It means that the Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces, as well as the Chief of Operations and the Chief of Army Intelligence are also Communists, men whose loyalties remain uncertain and are distrusted by most Afghans. </seg>
<seg id=1745> Is this a team likely to bring war-torn Afghanistan together? </seg>
<seg id=1746> Is the presence in Kabul of so dubious a crew likely to instill confidence in the three-quarters of Afghanistan's population who are shut out of the top army command? </seg>
<seg id=1747> Or is this list, rather, the harvest of a "winner-take-all" approach to governance that is bound (at some future point) to unleash another bloody national backlash by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled? </seg>
<seg id=1748> UN, European, and American policymakers should ponder these questions before allowing themselves to acquiesce in a ruthless power grab by a small and unpopular minority. </seg>
<seg id=1749> Celebrating the Irrational </seg>
<seg id=1750> Three cheers for the new Nobel laureates in economics: Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University, and Vernon Smith of George Mason University in Virginia. </seg>
<seg id=1751> Like many Nobel prizes, these awards recognize not only the seminal work undertaken by Kahneman and Smith, but also the schools of thought they help to lead. </seg>
<seg id=1752> Kahneman, a psychologist, has demonstrated how individuals systematically behave in ways less rational than orthodox economists believe they do. </seg>
<seg id=1753> His research shows not only that individuals sometimes act differently than standard economic theories predict, but that they do so regularly, systematically, and in ways that can be understood and interpreted through alternative hypotheses, competing with those utilized by orthodox economists. </seg>
<seg id=1754> To most market participants - and indeed, ordinary observers -- this does not seem like big news. </seg>
<seg id=1755> Wall Street brokers who peddled stocks they knew to be garbage exploited the irrationality that Kahneman and Smith exposed. </seg>
<seg id=1756> Much of the mania that led to the bubble economy was based on exploiting investor psychology. </seg>
<seg id=1757> In fact, this irrationality is no news to the economics profession either. </seg>
<seg id=1758> John Maynard Keynes long ago described the stock market as based not on rational individuals struggling to uncover market fundamentals, but as a beauty contest in which the winner is the one who guesses best what the judges will say. </seg>
<seg id=1759> This year's Nobel prize celebrates a critique of simplistic market economics, just as last year's award (of which I was one of the three winners) did. </seg>
<seg id=1760> Last year's laureates emphasized that different market participants have different (and imperfect) information, and these asymmetries in information have profound impact on how an economy functions. </seg>
<seg id=1761> In particular, last year's laureates implied that markets were not, in general, efficient; that there was an important role for government to play. </seg>
<seg id=1762> Adam Smith's invisible hand -- the idea that free markets lead to efficiency as if by an invisible hand -- is invisible at least in part because it is not there. </seg>
<seg id=1763> This, too, is not news to those who work day after day in the market (and make their fortunes by taking advantage of and overcoming asymmetries in information). </seg>
<seg id=1764> For more than twenty years economists were enthralled to so called "rational expectations" models which assumed that all participants have the same (if not perfect) information and act perfectly rationally, that markets are perfectly efficient, that unemployment never exists (except when caused by greedy unions or government minimum wages), and where there is never any credit rationing. </seg>
<seg id=1765> That such models prevailed, especially in America's graduate schools, despite evidence to the contrary bears testimony to a triumph of ideology over science. </seg>
<seg id=1766> Unfortunately, students of these graduate programs now act as policymakers in many countries, and are trying to implement programs based on the ideas that have come to be called market fundamentalism. </seg>
<seg id=1767> Let me be clear: the rational expectations models made an important contribution to economics; the rigor which its supporters imposed on economic thinking helped expose the weaknesses many underlying hypotheses. </seg>
<seg id=1768> Good science recognizes its limitations, but the prophets of rational expectations have usually shown no such modesty. </seg>
<seg id=1769> Vernon Smith is a leader in the development of experimental economics, the idea that one could test many economic propositions in laboratory settings. </seg>
<seg id=1770> One reason that economics is such a difficult subject, and why there are so many disagreements among economists, is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments. </seg>
<seg id=1771> Nature throws up natural experiments, but in most circumstances, so many things change so rapidly that it is often difficult to untangle what caused what. </seg>
<seg id=1772> In principle, in a laboratory, we can conduct controlled experiments, and therefore make more reliable inferences. </seg>
<seg id=1773> Critics of experimental economics worry that subjects bring to experimental situations modes of thought determined outside of the experiment, and thus that the experiments are not as clean and the inferences not as clear cut as in the physical sciences. </seg>
<seg id=1774> Nonetheless, economic experiments provide insights into a number of important issues, such as the improved design of auctions. </seg>
<seg id=1775> Most importantly, the irrationality of market participants, which was the focus of Kahneman's work, has been verified repeatedly in laboratory contexts. </seg>
<seg id=1776> Among the more amusing results that have come out of experimental economics are those concerning altruism and selfishness. </seg>
<seg id=1777> It appears (at least in experimental situations) that experimental subjects are not as selfish as economists have hypothesized--except for one group - the economists themselves. </seg>
<seg id=1778> Is it because economics as a discipline attracts individuals who are by nature more selfish or is it because economics helps shape individuals, making them more selfish? </seg>
<seg id=1779> The answer, almost certainly, is a little bit of both. </seg>
<seg id=1780> Presumably, future experimental research will help resolve the question of the relative importance of these two hypotheses. </seg>
<seg id=1781> The Nobel Prize signifies how important it is to study people and economies as they are, not as we want them to be. </seg>
<seg id=1782> Only by understanding better actual human behavior can we hope to design policies that will make our economies work better as well. </seg>
<seg id=1783> Bush's Bad-Faith Energy Policy </seg>
<seg id=1784> One of the more surreal sessions at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos had oil industry experts explaining how the melting of the polar ice cap -- which is occurring faster than anyone anticipated ­ -- represents not only a problem, but also an opportunity: vast amounts of oil may now be accessible. </seg>
<seg id=1785> Similarly, these experts concede that the fact that the United States has not signed the Law of the Sea, the international convention determining who has access to offshore oil and other maritime mineral rights, presents a risk of international conflict. </seg>
<seg id=1786> But they also point to the upside: the oil industry, in its never-ending search for more reserves, need not beg Congress for the right to despoil Alaska. </seg>
<seg id=1787> President George W. Bush has an uncanny ability not to see the big message. </seg>
<seg id=1788> For years, it has become increasingly clear that much is amiss with his energy policy. </seg>
<seg id=1789> Scripted by the oil industry, even members of his own party referred to an earlier energy bill as one that "left no lobbyist behind." </seg>
<seg id=1790> While praising the virtues of the free market, Bush has been only too willing to give huge handouts to the energy industry, even as the country faces soaring deficits. </seg>
<seg id=1791> There is a market failure when it comes to energy, but government intervention should run in precisely the opposite direction from what the Bush administration has proposed. </seg>
<seg id=1792> The fact that Americans do not pay the full price for the pollution -- especially enormous contributions to greenhouse gases -- that results from their profligate energy use means that energy is under-priced, in turn sustaining excessive consumption. </seg>
<seg id=1793> The government needs to encourage conservation, and intervening in the price system ­­ -- namely, through taxes on energy -- is an efficient way to do it. </seg>
<seg id=1794> But, rather than encouraging conservation, Bush has pursued a policy of "drain America first," leaving America more dependent on external oil in the future. </seg>
<seg id=1795> Never mind that high demand drives up oil prices, creating a windfall for many in the Middle East who are not among America's friends. </seg>
<seg id=1796> Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Bush appears to have finally woken up to the reality of America's increasing dependence; with soaring oil prices, it was hard for him not to note the consequences. </seg>
<seg id=1797> But, again, his administration's faltering moves will almost surely make matters worse in the immediate future. </seg>
<seg id=1798> Bush still refuses to do anything about conservation, and he has put very little money behind his continuing prayer than technology will save us. </seg>
<seg id=1799> What, then, to make of Bush's recent declaration of a commitment to make America 75% free of dependence on Middle East oil within 25 years. </seg>
<seg id=1800> For investors, the message is clear: do not invest more in developing reserves in the Middle East, which is by far the lowest-cost source of oil in the world. </seg>
<seg id=1801> But, without new investment in developing Middle East reserves, unbridled growth of energy consumption in the US, China, and elsewhere implies that demand will outpace supply. </seg>
<seg id=1802> If that were not enough, Bush's threat of sanctions against Iran poses the risks of interruptions of supplies from one of the world's largest producers. </seg>
<seg id=1803> With world oil production close to full capacity and prices already more than double their pre-Iraq War level, this portends still higher prices, and still higher profits for the oil industry -- the only clear winner in Bush's Middle East policy. </seg>
<seg id=1804> To be sure, one shouldn't begrudge Bush for having at last recognized that there is a problem. </seg>
<seg id=1805> But, as always, a closer look at what he is proposing suggests another sleight of hand by his administration. </seg>
<seg id=1806> Aside from refusing to recognize the importance of global warming, encourage conservation, or devote enough funds to research to make a real difference, Bush's grandiose promise of a reduction of dependence on Middle East oil means less than it appears. </seg>
<seg id=1807> With only 20% of US oil coming from the Middle East, his goal could be achieved by a modest shift of sourcing elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id=1808> But surely, one would think, the Bush administration must realize that oil trades on a global market. </seg>
<seg id=1809> Even if America were 100% independent of Middle East oil, a reduction in supply of Middle East oil could have devastating effects on the world price -- and on the American economy. </seg>
<seg id=1810> As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no flattering explanation of official policy. </seg>
<seg id=1811> Is Bush playing politics by pandering to anti-Arab and anti-Iranian sentiment in America? </seg>
<seg id=1812> Or is this just another example of incompetence and muddle? </seg>
<seg id=1813> From what we have seen over the past five years, the correct answer probably contains more than a little bad faith and sheer ineptitude. </seg>
<seg id=1814> China's Roadmap </seg>
<seg id=1815> China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, setting the stage for the continuation of probably the most remarkable economic transformation in history, while improving the well-being of almost a quarter of the world's population. </seg>
<seg id=1816> Never before has the world seen such sustained growth; never before has there been so much poverty reduction. </seg>
<seg id=1817> Part of the key to China's long-run success has been its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision. </seg>
<seg id=1818> While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington Consensus, has been directed at a quixotic quest for higher GDP, China has once again made clear that it seeks sustainable and more equitable increases in real living standards. </seg>
<seg id=1819> China realizes that it has entered a phase of economic growth that is imposing enormous -- and unsustainable -- demands on the environment. </seg>
<seg id=1820> Unless there is a change in course, living standards will eventually be compromised. </seg>
<seg id=1821> That is why the new five-year plan places great emphasis on the environment. </seg>
<seg id=1822> Even many of the more backward parts of China have been growing at a pace that would be a marvel, were it not for the fact that other parts of the country are growing even more rapidly. </seg>
<seg id=1823> While this has reduced poverty, inequality has been increasing, with growing disparities between cities and rural areas, and between coastal regions and the interior. </seg>
<seg id=1824> This year's World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, not just poverty, should be a concern, and China's 11th five-year plan attacks the problem head-on. </seg>
<seg id=1825> The government has for several years talked about a more harmonious society, and the plan describes ambitious programs for achieving this. </seg>
<seg id=1826> China recognizes, too, that what separates less developed from more developed countries is not only a gap in resources, but also a gap in knowledge. </seg>
<seg id=1827> So it has laid out bold plans not only to reduce that gap, but to create a basis for independent innovation. </seg>
<seg id=1828> China's role in the world and the world's economy has changed, and the plan reflects this, too. </seg>
<seg id=1829> Its future growth will have to be based more on domestic demand than on exports, which will require increases in consumption. </seg>
<seg id=1830> Indeed, China has a rare problem: excessive savings. </seg>
<seg id=1831> People save partly because of weaknesses in government social-insurance programs; strengthening social security (pensions) and public health and education will simultaneously reduce social inequalities, increase citizens' sense of well-being, and promote current consumption. </seg>
<seg id=1832> If successful -- and, so far, China has almost always surpassed even its own high expectations -- these adjustments may impose enormous strains on a global economic system that is already unbalanced by America's huge fiscal and trade imbalances. </seg>
<seg id=1833> If China saves less -- and if, as officials have announced, it pursues a more diversified policy of investing its reserves -- who will finance America's more than $2 billion a day trade deficit? </seg>
<seg id=1834> This is a topic for another day, but that day may not be far off. </seg>
<seg id=1835> With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge will be implementation. </seg>
<seg id=1836> China is a large country, and it could not have succeeded as it has without widespread decentralization. </seg>
<seg id=1837> But decentralization raises problems of its own. </seg>
<seg id=1838> Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems. </seg>
<seg id=1839> While America says that it cannot afford to do anything about it, China's senior officials have acted more responsibly. </seg>
<seg id=1840> Within a month of the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline, and wood products were imposed: China was using market based mechanisms to address its and the world's environmental problems. </seg>
<seg id=1841> But the pressures on local government officials to deliver economic growth and jobs will be enormous. </seg>
<seg id=1842> They will be sorely tempted to argue that if America cannot afford to produce in a way that preserves our planet, how can we? </seg>
<seg id=1843> To translate its vision into action, the Chinese government will need strong policies, such as the environmental taxes already imposed. </seg>
<seg id=1844> As China has moved toward a market economy, it has developed some of the problems that have plagued the developed countries: special interests that clothe self-serving arguments behind a thin veil of market ideology. </seg>
<seg id=1845> Some will argue for trickle-down economics: don't worry about the poor, eventually everybody will benefit from growth. </seg>
<seg id=1846> And some will oppose competition policy and strong corporate governance laws: let Darwinian survival work its wonders. </seg>
<seg id=1847> Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: higher gasoline taxes, for example, will kill our nascent auto industry. </seg>
<seg id=1848> Such allegedly pro-growth policies would not only fail to deliver growth; they would threaten the entire vision of China's future. </seg>
<seg id=1849> There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today. </seg>
<seg id=1850> George W. Bush has shown the dangers of excessive secrecy and confining decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophants. </seg>
<seg id=1851> Most people outside China do not fully appreciate the extent to which its leaders, by contrast, have engaged in extensive deliberations and broad consultations (even with foreigners) as they strive to solve the enormous problems they face. </seg>
<seg id=1852> Market economies are not self-regulating. </seg>
<seg id=1853> They cannot simply be left on autopilot, especially if one wants to ensure that their benefits are shared widely. </seg>
<seg id=1854> But managing a market economy is no easy task. </seg>
<seg id=1855> It is a balancing act that must constantly respond to economic changes. </seg>
<seg id=1856> China's 11th five-year plan provides a roadmap for that response. </seg>
<seg id=1857> The world watches in awe, and hope, as the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be transformed. </seg>
<seg id=1858> Tocqueville's Lessons in Democracy </seg>
<seg id=1859> It seems appropriate that, due to the Iraq war, the world has been debating the nature of democracy 200 years after Alexis de Tocqueville's birth. </seg>
<seg id=1860> Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy's triumph as our destiny, while warning against the dangers that democracy holds for liberty. </seg>
<seg id=1861> Should we still share his worries? </seg>
<seg id=1862> Tocqueville viewed democracy not only as a political regime, but, above all, as an intellectual regime that shapes a society's customs in general, thereby giving it a sociological and psychological dimension. </seg>
<seg id=1863> Democratic regimes, Tocqueville argued, determine our thoughts, desires, and passions. </seg>
<seg id=1864> Just as there was Renaissance man and, in the twentieth century, homo sovieticus, "democratic man" is a form of human being. </seg>
<seg id=1865> For Tocqueville, democracy's systemic effects could lead citizens to deprive themselves of reasoned thought. </seg>
<seg id=1866> They could only pretend to judge events and values on their own; in reality, they would merely copy the rough and simplified opinions of the masses. </seg>
<seg id=1867> Indeed, what Tocqueville called the hold of "social power" on opinion is probably strongest in democratic regimes -- a view that foretells the growth of modern-day demagogy and media manipulation. </seg>
<seg id=1868> Tocqueville believed that there are no effective long-term constraints on this tendency. </seg>
<seg id=1869> Neither local democracy nor small societies, neither governmental checks and balances nor civil rights, can prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy seems to cause. </seg>
<seg id=1870> Schools have the power to be little more than enclaves from the corrosive strength of social influences on how the mind works. </seg>
<seg id=1871> Similarly, while Tocqueville thought that pursuing virtue as the ancients did, or having a religious faith, could sometimes elevate the soul, both conflict with the democratic ideal if they become officially prescribed in public life. </seg>
<seg id=1872> In this sense, Tocqueville's intellectual heirs include the neo-Marxist theorists of the Frankfurt School, as well as Hannah Arendt, all of whom feared above all the disintegration of reason in modern societies. </seg>
<seg id=1873> Indeed, the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled a recent book Democracy Against Itself. </seg>
<seg id=1874> The democratic way of life, these writers argue, tends to destroy original thought and to suppress "high" culture, yielding a mediocrity that leaves citizens vulnerable to democracy's enemies. </seg>
<seg id=1875> But, while history is replete with murderous regimes applauded by cowed and deceived masses, the greater risk for democratic nations is that their citizens withdraw into apathy and short-term thinking for immediate gratification. </seg>
<seg id=1876> The past -- despite rituals that seek to commemorate historic moments -- is obliterated by an addiction to the now and the new. </seg>
<seg id=1877> Even the supposedly well-educated ruling class is subject to this bewitchment. </seg>
<seg id=1878> The essential problem of the democratic mind is its lack of historical consciousness. </seg>
<seg id=1879> Do the defects of democracy really mean, as Tocqueville claimed, that resigned pessimism is the only -- realistic but unsustainable -- path open to us? </seg>
<seg id=1880> I don't think so. </seg>
<seg id=1881> There are means to fight against what might be called today's growing "democratic stupidity." </seg>
<seg id=1882> The first defense is to push for an educational system that really forms critical minds, namely through the (nowadays) largely neglected subjects of literature, history, and philosophy. </seg>
<seg id=1883> If the informed and critical citizenry that democracy requires is to be formed, our schools must stop pandering to the latest popular fads and begin to sharpen the analytical capacities of students. </seg>
<seg id=1884> The biggest impediment to such an education are the mass media, with its tendency to cultivate superficiality and amusement. </seg>
<seg id=1885> Many people nowadays spend more of their lives watching television than they do in classrooms. </seg>
<seg id=1886> The passivity that mass media encourages is the polar opposite of the active engagement that democratic citizens need. </seg>
<seg id=1887> But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (other than quality newspapers) would, of their own volition, become instruments of an education that enhances citizens' critical capacities. </seg>
<seg id=1888> This concern about mass media is no mere elitist scorn for popular culture. </seg>
<seg id=1889> The question is not one of popularity alone -- after all, Mozart was popular in his day, and Shakespeare's plays attracted the poor as well as the rich -- but of mass culture's refusal to challenge and provoke. </seg>
<seg id=1890> The result of the failure is a generalized indifference and passivity in audiences. </seg>
<seg id=1891> Indeed, for a long time a globalized media culture, one unable to inspire the capacity for critical thought or create elevated feelings, has been on the rise. </seg>
<seg id=1892> It is a culture that, through its carelessness, threatens democratic freedom because it fails to create any sense of obligation -- to society, to history, to community. </seg>
<seg id=1893> Is it too late to do anything about a culture that so deadens the spirit? </seg>
<seg id=1894> Tocqueville despised the elites of his time for their complacency in the face of the deracinating force of mass democracy. </seg>
<seg id=1895> Will the myopia of our leaders also serve as an agent of his disquieting prophecy? </seg>
<seg id=1896> A Europe for All </seg>
<seg id=1897> Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union's future, but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration. </seg>
<seg id=1898> To join in the EU's progress is the basic object of our foreign policy, for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end, but a beginning. </seg>
<seg id=1899> Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when one nation is ostracized, all are not free. </seg>
<seg id=1900> We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net, tied in a single garment of destiny. </seg>
<seg id=1901> Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms that for us. </seg>
<seg id=1902> Whatever affects one European directly, affects all indirectly. </seg>
<seg id=1903> Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes, of haves and have-nots, of insiders and outsiders. </seg>
<seg id=1904> Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot -- indeed, must not -- be considered a stranger to its Union. </seg>
<seg id=1905> Today's great Pax Europa and today's pan-European prosperity depend on this. </seg>
<seg id=1906> Of course, some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1907> Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people, young and old, factory worker, farmer's wife, the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms. </seg>
<seg id=1908> Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance? </seg>
<seg id=1909> Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930's, who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970's? </seg>
<seg id=1910> Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland's Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague's Velvet Revolution in 1989? </seg>
<seg id=1911> That is the true European spirit, and no doubts can crush it. </seg>
<seg id=1912> To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: Let them, too, come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer. </seg>
<seg id=1913> Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English. </seg>
<seg id=1914> Those who doubt Ukraine's European vocation should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and superhighways; it is the unquenchable desire for freedom, prosperity, and solidarity. </seg>
<seg id=1915> I believe that our future is as promising as Europe's past is proud, and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region, but as a maker and shaper of Europe's peace and Europe's unity. </seg>
<seg id=1916> Self-determination no longer means isolation, because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status. </seg>
<seg id=1917> New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany -- a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests. </seg>
<seg id=1918> That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia, and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe's peace. </seg>
<seg id=1919> Of course, it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership. </seg>
<seg id=1920> We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight. </seg>
<seg id=1921> We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations, but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans. </seg>
<seg id=1922> Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap, or fast. </seg>
<seg id=1923> But, like the Union itself, it will be built and it will be done. </seg>
<seg id=1924> We know the challenge is great, but the prize is worth the struggle, and Europe should know that this is our goal. </seg>
<seg id=1925> Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism -- ideologies born in the heart of Europe -- battled for mastery. </seg>
<seg id=1926> Only a few months ago, in cities throughout Ukraine, our children and our parents confronted armed troops, snarling dogs, and even death. </seg>
<seg id=1927> Only a few years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about our old regime's corruption, was brutalized and beheaded by that regime's thugs. </seg>
<seg id=1928> But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine's people prevailed. </seg>
<seg id=1929> So, despite today's doubts and difficulties, I retain an abiding faith in Europe. </seg>
<seg id=1930> I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine's history. </seg>
<seg id=1931> I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism's legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity. </seg>
<seg id=1932> When the EU's citizens ponder Ukraine's place in Europe, they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see. </seg>
<seg id=1933> They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted, beyond the poverty, and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule. </seg>
<seg id=1934> Instead, they should look closely at the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, ravaged by poison during last year's election campaign, and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux, for whom "the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded." </seg>
<seg id=1935> The Muslim Civil War </seg>
<seg id=1936> Is the Sunni-Shia divide in the Middle East now deeper than the antagonism between Israel and the Arabs? </seg>
<seg id=1937> You might think so given the response of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision to attack Israel. </seg>
<seg id=1938> Even as Israeli bombs fell on Beirut and Tyre, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most conservative Arab Muslim state of all, openly condemned the actions of the Shia Hezbollah in instigating conflict with Israel. </seg>
<seg id=1939> Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has a state that considers itself a leader of the Arab Muslim peoples backed Israel so openly. </seg>
<seg id=1940> Moreover, Saudi Arabia's breach with Hezbollah is not a one-time occurrence. </seg>
<seg id=1941> Egypt and Jordan have also roundly condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism. </seg>
<seg id=1942> What is behind this stunning development? </seg>
<seg id=1943> Are we seeing a fundamental shift in relations between Arab nationalism and Islamic sectarianism? </seg>
<seg id=1944> Is Saudi Arabia's Sunni government more concerned and frightened by Shia Islam than it is committed to Arab unity and the Palestinian cause? </seg>
<seg id=1945> Arab denunciations of Hezbollah suggest that the Muslim sectarian divide, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, is deepening and intensifying across the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id=1946> President George W. Bush's desire to shatter the Arab world's frozen societies was meant to pit the forces of modernization against the traditional elements in Arab and Islamic societies. </seg>
<seg id=1947> Instead, he appears to have unleashed the region's most atavistic forces. </seg>
<seg id=1948> Opening this Pandora's Box may have ushered in a new and even uglier era of generalized violence, perhaps what can only be called a "Muslim Civil War." </seg>
<seg id=1949> The Shia-Sunni divide has existed from the dawn of Islam, but the geographical and ethnic isolation of non-Arab Shiite Iran, together with Sunni Arab countries' dominance of their Shia minorities, mostly kept this rivalry in the background. </seg>
<seg id=1950> These tensions further receded in the tide of the "Islamization" created by the Iranian revolution, for in its wake Arabs' sectarian identity as Sunni was pushed further into the background as a generalized "Islamic" assertiveness appeared. </seg>
<seg id=1951> That all changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist force that draws heavily on Saudi Wahabbi ideology and personnel, launched its attacks on America in September 2001. </seg>
<seg id=1952> A specifically Sunni brand of militant Islam was now on the march. </seg>
<seg id=1953> When the United States initiated wars on both the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and the Sunni Iraqi regime, this new radical Sunni strain became even more emboldened. </seg>
<seg id=1954> The region's newly assertive Sunni Arabs perceive Israel and the West as being only one threat, the other comprising the so-called "Shia crescent" -- the arc of land extending from Lebanon to Iran through Syria and Iraq that is inhabited by the allegedly heretical Shia. </seg>
<seg id=1955> Saudi Arabia's rulers, as custodians of the Muslim faith's holiest places in Mecca and Medina, perhaps feel this threat most keenly. </seg>
<seg id=1956> In Sunni eyes, the Shia not only dominate the oil-rich areas of Iran, Iraq, and the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, but are -- through the actions of Hezbollah -- attempting to usurp the role of "protector" of the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause. </seg>
<seg id=1957> It is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni Islam and doubts the loyalty of its Shia population that the Kingdom has turned on Hezbollah. </seg>
<seg id=1958> Ironically, it is America, Saudi Arabia's longtime protector, which made Shia empowerment possible by overthrowing Saddam Hussein and bringing Shiite parties to power in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id=1959> The Bush administration seems to recognize what it has done; as the Shia arc rises in the east of the Arab Muslim world, the US is attempting to strengthen its protection of the Sunni arc -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia -- in the region's west. </seg>
<seg id=1960> Israel, the once implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems to be slotted into this defensive structure. </seg>
<seg id=1961> But such a defensive posture is bound to be unstable, due to pan-Arab feelings. </seg>
<seg id=1962> Today, ordinary Saudi citizens are glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to follow events in Gaza and south Lebanon. </seg>
<seg id=1963> They see Arab (not Shiite) blood being shed, with only Hezbollah fighting back. </seg>
<seg id=1964> In their eyes, Hezbollah has become a heroic model of resistance. </seg>
<seg id=1965> This is causing the Saudi state to deepen the Sunni-Shia schism. </seg>
<seg id=1966> Following the Kingdom's official denunciation of Hezbollah, the Saudi state called on its official Wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah as Shiite deviants and heretics. </seg>
<seg id=1967> Such condemnations can only sharpen sectarian divisions within Saudi Arabia and the region. </seg>
<seg id=1968> As these antagonisms deepen, will the Sunni regimes come to believe that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner? </seg>
<seg id=1969> If that is what they conclude, they need not look far, for many such fighters have already have been trained -- by Al Qaeda. </seg>
<seg id=1970> Georgia on Europe's Mind </seg>
<seg id=1971> The era in which Europe could rely on America to wage war, make peace, and establish democracy in its own backyard is over. </seg>
<seg id=1972> With European Union enlargement, and as the recent Russian gas crisis demonstrated, that backyard now includes not just Ukraine, but Georgia as well. </seg>
<seg id=1973> Indeed, as in Ukraine, Georgia is undergoing a test of democracy that Europe cannot afford to ignore. </seg>
<seg id=1974> Georgia was the first post-Soviet country to stage a "color revolution," and thus to demonstrate, with dignity and maturity, its people's choice for democracy and European values. </seg>
<seg id=1975> The European Union flags that have flown on all Georgian public buildings since then signal a natural attachment, as old as the history of a country that, for the ancient Greeks, was an integral part of the world as it was then known. </seg>
<seg id=1976> Prometheus, Medea, the Amazons and, in neighboring Armenia, Noah's Ark -- the Europe of our myths starts here. </seg>
<seg id=1977> With its history, culture, and traditions -- including its critical, independent, and even rebellious spirit within the former Soviet Union -- Georgia would seem to be an ideal candidate for successful democratization. </seg>
<seg id=1978> So it is all the more worrisome that democratization there is foundering. </seg>
<seg id=1979> Everything seemed to have started well enough. </seg>
<seg id=1980> Political reforms, privatization, anti-corruption measures, a search for new leaders untainted by compromise with the former regime, and implementation of a pro-European foreign policy met no resistance. </seg>
<seg id=1981> But the totalitarian mindset has since resurfaced in leaders who, with their claim to represent the will of the majority, appropriate more and more power. </seg>
<seg id=1982> Like the ancient Greeks' Hydra, Georgia's political elite never ceases to die and be reborn. </seg>
<seg id=1983> The same people and governing methods that the "Rose Revolution" of November 2003 sought to defeat have reemerged at the center of power by using their personal networks, which extend outside Georgia's borders, as well as their tremendous wealth and finely honed skills at political scheming and manipulation. </seg>
<seg id=1984> This bears little in common with the essence of democracy, which consists not merely in ballot boxes, but in the separation of powers. </seg>
<seg id=1985> The government meddles in the affairs of the parliament, which in turn seeks to micro-manage the government -- including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their daily routines! </seg>
<seg id=1986> Finally, and more seriously, the judiciary is not yet independent, undermining the rule of law and thus deterring badly needed private investment. </seg>
<seg id=1987> Georgia's democracy exists in its head, but not yet in its body: citizens still spurn politics as a dirty pursuit, abandoning the ground to those who should have been retired long ago. </seg>
<seg id=1988> But the hope of democracy remains strongly rooted in Georgia's people, civic organizations, and media. </seg>
<seg id=1989> Now is the time for Europe to ensure that this hope is not extinguished. </seg>
<seg id=1990> The US has already done as much as it can to support political stability in Georgia since independence. </seg>
<seg id=1991> To be sure, stability was not always identified with democracy during the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Union foreign minister who was ousted as our president by the Rose Revolution. </seg>
<seg id=1992> But Americans invested generously in the survival of democratic ideas and leaders. </seg>
<seg id=1993> Although the foundation backed by the financier George Soros did not fabricate the Rose Revolution, as Russian nationalists claim, it certainly nurtured, encouraged, and supported democracy's preconditions. </seg>
<seg id=1994> But, to help consolidate its democracy, Georgia now requires support of a different nature, which Europe is better equipped to offer. </seg>
<seg id=1995> The models for the balance of powers, the functioning of the judiciary, and local democracy must be inspired by European forms, which are closer to Georgian reality than Anglo-Saxon models of the American type. </seg>
<seg id=1996> Europe's rejection of this challenge would betray its fundamental duties in a place -- small, Mediterranean, flexible, with old historical traditions -- where democracy stands a much greater chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both huge and still very Soviet-minded, not to mention Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id=1997> Indeed, refusal to support Georgia's struggling democracy would most likely postpone democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus, even in Russia itself. </seg>
<seg id=1998> This clearly raises the stakes. </seg>
<seg id=1999> Russia, while never renouncing its imperial dreams and instruments of domination, was nonetheless coming to terms with the inevitability of democracy, at least on its margins. </seg>
<seg id=2000> But this hesitant acceptance of a certain normality in its relations with its neighbors has always been vulnerable to a sudden eruption of Russia's famously irrational "derzhava" -- an aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and asserts its strength by pouncing on weakness. </seg>
<seg id=2001> This is the key to understanding the recent Russian gas crisis. </seg>
<seg id=2002> Just as surely, any sign of a retreat from democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states will merely fuel Russia's neo-imperial ambitions. </seg>
<seg id=2003> It is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past. </seg>
<seg id=2004> Europe must assume this role not only to ensure the future independence of its energy supply, but also to demonstrate that European values of freedom, democracy, and justice between peoples have real force. </seg>
<seg id=2005> To succeed, Europe must equip itself with the necessary instruments: a large semi-public foundation to promote Europe and support political reform, a university to train future executives of nascent democracies, a police force, and an army of judges and magistrates to breathe life into the models that we want to emulate. </seg>
<seg id=2006> Above all, Europe needs conviction. </seg>
<seg id=2007> If Europe today cannot convince itself that it has a vital interest in its neighbors' future, who will believe in Europe tomorrow? </seg>
