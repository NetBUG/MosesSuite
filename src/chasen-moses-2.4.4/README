What's chasen?
--------------

Chasen is a Japanese Word Segmentor, which was developed by 奈良先端科学技術大学
院大学情報科学研究科自然言語処理学講座(松本研究室), and depends on the
Darts(Double-ARray Trie System).

You can find more information on http://sourceforge.jp/projects/chasen-legacy/.

I integrated Chasen, Darts(dependent file which implement the Double ARray Trie System)
and the dictionaries into one package to simplify the compilation and depolyment. Current
 version of these software as below:
 - Chasen 2.4.4
 - Darts 0.3.2
 - ipadic 2.7.0

You can find the doc about Darts 0.3.2 at http://www.chasen.org/~taku/software/darts/.

Chasen for moses follow the same version as chasen.

Chasen and Encoding Support
---------------------------

Originally, Chasen support the encoding EUC-JP and UTF-8 both. But
unfortunately, we cannot support them simultaneously. We have to convert the
encoding of dictionary files and configuration file into UTF-8. You can refer
the URL http://www.crimson-snow.net/hmsvr/centos/memo/chasen_utf8.html and the
Makefile in dic directory in this package.

Now, the chasen in this package support UTF-8.

How to use the Chasen
---------------------

    # use the chasen to tokenize the Japanese text.
    $ ./chasen -i w input.file > output.file

How to install chasen-moses
---------------------------

    # compile and build the chasen and dic tools.
    $ cd src
    $ make
    $ make install

The installation step will copy the makemat and makeda into the dic directory.
Then you can change the working directory into dic, which include all source dic
files and grammar files, and run the make to create the matrix.cha, table.cha
and dictionary file (default named as chadic.*) used by chasen.

    $ ./makemat -i w
    $ ./makeda -i w chadic *.dic

you can create the grammar and dic files just by running make.
    $ make

Configuration
-------------

Please put the configuration file 'chasenrc' with the same directory as chasen.
This configuration file should be same encoding as what you want to support,
i.e. UTF-8 in this package.

You can customize chasenrc to get the different output, specify the
location for dic file.

Motivation
----------

Why creating this package or not using the original tar package distributed by
original author?

 - We want that chasen can support UTF-8, so we have to convert some files and 
 creating some new files.

 - For support to run chasen on MacOSX, we have to generate some source file for
 this platform. please run the configure script in original package to create the
 config.h and darts.h for MacOSX.
