<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Moses Suite is developed for supporting OpenSource Machine Translation framework 
Moses SMT. Currently Moses Suite has several parts: </p>

<ul>
<li>Moses suite base system</li>
<li>SMT Corpus Tools</li>
<li>Moses suite training tools</li>
</ul><p>Moses suite base system integrate upstream software (Moses and Language models)
to build a base system of moses for training and decoding. Other tools aim to 
provide better solution for corpus processing, training and other works in
more user friendly, flexible and customiziable way. If possible, improving user
experience is on the list of objectives.</p>

<p>Since the storage limitation of github, I put the source code from upstream at 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/moses-suite/">http://code.google.com/p/moses-suite/</a>.</p>

<p>If you find this project very interesting, don't hesitate to join me :D</p>

<p>Generally, most of source code is written from scratch for Moses Suite, apparently 
is under BSD 2-Clause License. Some upstream sources code will be included in this
repository also just after we need to modify something. Please notify me via email
(<a href="mailto:leo.jiang.dev@gmail.com">leo.jiang.dev@gmail.com</a>) if the source code can't be modified and redistributed 
since I misunderstand your license. I will remove them from repository as soon as 
I can. Otherwise, I will put them under your original license or the project's 
license (BSD 2-Clause License) if original one is a permissive open source license. 
You can find their own license files in root directory of sub-project.</p>
