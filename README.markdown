# Moses Suite
Author: [Leo Jiang](leo.jiang.dev@gmail.com) Blog: http://leohacker.wordpress.com/.

Moses Suite is developed for supporting OpenSource Machine Translation framework Moses SMT. I will provide some tools to deploy the precompiled moses packages and additional tools to manage corpus files and make the training of moses engine automatically. Furthormore, I will more features when they are raised up in my mind. KISS!

And this project will be an experimental project for myself to apply whole agile development process. One person for all roles in a scrum team :) Just for fun!

And if you find this project very interesting, don't hesitate to join me :D
